# Civil Engineering Technology, B.S.E.T.

Civil Engineering Technology includes computer-aided drafting (CAD); structures (analysis, design of structural steel and reinforced concrete); construction (cost estimating, construction planning and administration); transportation (surveying, highway design and construction); water resources (hydraulics, hydrology, and environmental); and geotechnical (soil mechanics, foundations and earthwork).

The Civil Engineering Technology program shares a common curriculum with the Construction Management program for the first two years. Students may move between the common programs until the Junior year when the curricula diverge. At the end of the Sophomore year, students must select either the analysis and design-oriented Civil Engineering Technology BSET degree or the management-oriented BSCM program.

AAS transfer students from approved programs receive 64 credit hours for the AAS degree; thus, AAS students need only to complete the upper-division portion of the courses listed below and remediate any entrance deficiencies noted upon matriculation.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements
***
#### First-Year Students
First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) for a detailed description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years. This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

#### Transfers
All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).

- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854)   
- Minimum GPA: 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)
- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  
  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to MATH 1241), with a grade of C or above
  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to MATH 1103) or higher, with a grade of C or above
- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24

Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.

## Currently Enrolled Students
***
Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Civil Engineering Technology must:
- Complete the College of Engineering Common First Year (or equivalent courses) in order to be considered eligible for admission. See **Common First-Year Courses** below.
- Achieve a GPA between 2.2 - 4.0.
- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the [Change of Major](http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform) form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.

#### Course Requirements
Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.
- **Entering First-Year Students**: Students admitted as First-Year students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.
- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.
- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.

#### Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers
Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:
- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)
- Precalculus (3 credit hours)
- General Physics (with lab) (4 credit hours)
- Additional Physics (with lab) or Geology (3-4 credit hours)
- Technical Courses in Major Area (up to 41 credit hours)
  - ET Computer Applications

  - Construction Surveying
  - Statics
  - Strength of Materials
  - Construction Materials with Lab
  - Construction Methods
  - Hydraulics or hydrology or environmental technology
  - Building Information Modeling
  - Plan Reading and Quantity Takeoff

#### Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students
In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year. Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in Senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.

## Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY)
***
The College of Engineering uses a Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY) for all Engineering students in order to:
- Provide a strong academic base of foundational knowledge and skills
- Facilitate changing majors within the first year
- Support students with lower math placement and increase access to all majors
- Allow students to explore different majors before committing
- Enhance learning with innovative pedagogies and activities

##### Common First-Year Courses
All new first year students are initially advised by a central office within the W.S. Lee College of Engineering. Students must complete the following classes that are common to all majors of the college (except Construction Management and Fire and Safety Engineering Technology) in order to progress and matriculate to their major department. _All First-Year Curriculum courses require a grade of C or better._

## Special Policies or Requirements
***
Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.

#### Residence Requirements
A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.

#### Experiential Learning Requirements
All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student's transcript; students pay a course registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program. For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.
