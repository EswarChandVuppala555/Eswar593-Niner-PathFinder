# Fire and Safety Engineering Technology, Fire Safety Concentration, B.S.E.T.

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program include Fire Safety and Occupational Safety. Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

The Fire Safety concentration is intended for students who seek a career within the fire service. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for increasingly responsible roles in leadership and management. In addition, the program provides comprehensive classes dealing with fire behavior, active and passive protection systems as well as the foundational principles of research investigation. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Fire Safety concentration.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements
***
Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year students or as transfer students.
#### First-Year Students
Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general University admission requirements. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854).
#### Transfers
See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854).
Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:
1. Transfer applicants who do not have the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.
2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:
- Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter. Acceptable AAS degrees may include: Fire Protection, Fire Science, or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department. A minimum GPA of 2.50 (out of 4.00) in the AAS degree is required.
- Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter. Missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte.

## Currently Enrolled Students
***
Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Fire and Safety Engineering Technology must first satisfy the following requirements in order to be considered eligible for admission:
- Complete MATH 1100 or higher with a grade of C or better.
- Achieve a GPA between 2.2 - 4.0.
- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is passed within three attempts.
- Complete at least one ETFS course from the curriculum courses listed below. 
  - ETFS 1120 Introduction to Fire Protection
  - ETFS 1152 Fire Protection and Safety Law
  - ETFS 2124 Introduction to Fire Prevention
  - ETFS 2132 Building Construction for Fire Protection
  - ETFS 2256 Fire Service Community Relations

Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the [Change of Major](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform?usp=sf_link) form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.

#### Course Requirements
Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.
- **Entering First-Year Students:** Students admitted as First-Year students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.
- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree:** Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.
- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree:** Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Fire Protection degree may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.

#### Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers
Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:
- College Algebra (3 credit hours) or higher
- STAT 1220 (3 credit hours) equivalent

## Special Policies or Requirements
***
Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.

#### Residence Requirements
A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.

#### Experiential Learning Requirements
All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, Senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student's transcript; students pay a course registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program. For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.
