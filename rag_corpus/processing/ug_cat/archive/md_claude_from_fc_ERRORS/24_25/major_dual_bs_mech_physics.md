# Physics and Mechanical Engineering, B.S. Dual Degree

The [Department of Physics and Optical Science](http://physics.uncc.edu/) and [Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science](http://mees.uncc.edu/) offer a dual degree designed to broaden and enhance the education of students in the mechanical engineering and physics degree programs. Students can obtain a [B.S. in Physics](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10813) and [B.S. in Mechanical Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10719) dual degree.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461).

## Degree Requirements
***
To obtain a dual B.S. degree in both Physics and Mechanical Engineering, undergraduate students must complete all requirements for the B.S.M.E. degree as established by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science. In addition, students must complete 12 credit hours of upper-division PHYS courses specified by the Department of Physics and Optical Science with an average grade C or above. A B.S. in Physics under this program will be awarded at the same time as or after the B.S.M.E. The B.S. in Physics degree will not be awarded in advance of the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering degree.

Students in this dual degree program are not required to fulfill the [College of Science Foreign Language Requirement](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=11428).
