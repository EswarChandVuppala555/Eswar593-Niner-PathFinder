# Mechanical Engineering Technology, Applied Energy Concentration, B.S.E.T.

A Concentration in Applied Energy is available to BSET in Mechanical Engineering Technology students.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements

### First-Year Students
First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See University Admission Requirements for a detailed description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years. This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

### Transfers
All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).  

- See University Admission Requirements  
- Minimum GPA: 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)
- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  
  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to MATH 1241), with a grade of C or above
  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to MATH 1103) or higher, with a grade of C or above
- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24

Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.

## Currently Enrolled Students

Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Mechanical Engineering Technology, must first satisfy the following requirements in order to be considered eligible for admission:

- Complete MATH 1103 or higher with a grade of C or better.
- Complete PHYS 1101 and PHYS 1101L or higher Physics course with a grade of C or better.
- Earn a minimum 2.20 cumulative GPA.
- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is passed within three attempts.
- Complete at least one the following courses for their desired major:
  - ETME 1111, ETME 1112, or ETGR 2101 with a grade of C or better

Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the Change of Major Form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.

### Course Requirements
Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.

- **Entering First-Year Students**: Students admitted as First-Year students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.
- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.
- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.

## Progression Requirements

### First-Year Students
All First-Year students, early college students, and transfer students with only one semester at another institution are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.   

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.
- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.
- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.
- Complete all core courses in the first-year curriculum with grades of C or above.
  - Core courses include ETME 1111, ETME 1112, in addition to ETGR 1201, and the First-Year science and math requirements.
- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Complete the first-year curriculum within four regular semesters.
- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year curriculum.

### Sophomore Through Senior Year
- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.
- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
- Take courses in the curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

## Special Policies or Requirements

Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.

### Residence Requirements
A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.

### Experiential Learning Requirements
All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student's transcript; students pay a course registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program. For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.
