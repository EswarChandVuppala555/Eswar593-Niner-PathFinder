# Physics and Electrical Engineering, B.S. Dual Degree

The Department of Physics and Optical Science offers two dual degree opportunities with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. These dual degrees are designed to broaden and enhance the education of students in engineering degree programs. Students can obtain a B.S. Physics and B.S. Electrical Engineering dual degree or a B.S. Physics and B.S. Computer Engineering dual degree.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements

#### Freshmen and Transfers
- See University Admission Requirements
- _Minimum GPA:_ 2.0 (cumulative and Physics)
- _Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:_ Complete the following with grades of C or above and no more than 2 attempts per course: 
  - PHYS 2101
  - PHYS 2102
  - MATH 2241

#### Currently Enrolled Students
- _Declaration of Major:_ Engineering majors wishing to declare the B.S. in Physics degree are eligible to do so after meeting the above requirements.

## Degree Requirements

To obtain a dual B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Physics, undergraduate students must complete all requirements for the B.S.E.E. degree as established by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In addition, students must complete 12 credit hours of upper-division PHYS courses specified by the Department of Physics and Optical Science with an average grade of C or above. A B.S. in Physics under this program is awarded at the same time as or after the B.S.E.E.; the B.S. in Physics degree will not be awarded in advance of the engineering degree.

Students in this dual degree program are not required to fulfill the College of Science Foreign Language Requirement.
