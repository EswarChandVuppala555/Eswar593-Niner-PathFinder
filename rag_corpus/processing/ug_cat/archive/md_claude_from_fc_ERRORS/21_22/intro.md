## Degree Programs
***
### Engineering Programs
The baccalaureate programs in engineering offer a professional engineering education that can be used as the foundation for several different career objectives: careers as professional engineers in industry, business, or consulting; graduate study to prepare for careers in research, development, or teaching; and a more general and more liberal engineering education with the objective of keeping a variety of career paths open. 

Whatever the career objective of the student, a sound engineering educational program is provided. The course of study will involve the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences and design. The student expecting to accept employment in industry may emphasize the engineering design and engineering science aspects of his or her program, while the student preparing for graduate study might emphasize the mathematics and science aspects. Some engineering graduates ultimately take on executive and management responsibilities in industries and firms that are based upon engineering products and engineering services. These students may choose to construct an elective option in their program, including economics and business-related courses that strengthen their communication skills and other non-technical skills.

Engineering students are strongly encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer (PE). The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure subsequent to graduation include the accumulation of at least four years of progressive engineering experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need three years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.

### Engineering Technology Programs
Engineering technology is the profession in which knowledge of mathematics and natural sciences gained by higher education, experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity. Engineering technology education focuses primarily on the applied aspects of science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in that portion of the technological spectrum closest to the product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions.

Engineering technology programs are characterized by a focus on application and practice and on an approximately equal mix of theory, practice, and laboratory experience.

Graduates of the engineering technology programs are recruited by most major technological companies in the U.S. They are employed across the technological spectrum but are best suited to areas that deal with application, implementation, production, and construction. Technical sales and customer service fields also account for many placements.

Engineering technology students are encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer. The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure following graduation include the accumulation of at least eight years of progressive experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need seven years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.

Students are encouraged to participate in professional work experiences in support of their academic and career development through the cooperative education, internships and service learning programs offered to students in the College. The College works with the University Career Center to expand experiential learning offerings to enable more students to graduate with career related experience. For more information about experiential learning opportunities, see the [University Career Center](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7788#ucc) section of this Catalog and visit [osds.uncc.edu](https://osds.uncc.edu/).

#### Cooperative Education (Co-op) Program
Students may obtain practical work experience while pursuing their degree by participating in cooperative education whereby a student alternates semesters of full-time academic study with semesters of full-time work experience in industry. Students may also do back-to-back Co-op experiences if their Fall or Spring semester Co-op session is combined with a Summer session. The work experience is under the direction of the student's major department and is closely related to his or her field of study. Students who fulfill all requirements of the Co-op program receive transcript notation, can earn up to three credit hours for a technical elective, and will receive partial credit toward the professional practice requirement for registration as a Professional Engineer in North Carolina.

To be eligible for the Co-op program, a student must have completed at least 30 credit hours at UNC Charlotte, including a number of specified courses with an overall minimum GPA of 2.5. A transfer student is expected to have completed at least 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte.

For an undergraduate to be officially designated as a Co-op student, he or she must participate in at least three full-time semesters of work experience (three work sessions and three seminar courses). Consequently, participation in Co-op Education usually means that graduation can be delayed up to one year. However, students who participate in Co-op traditionally are more highly recruited at higher starting salaries than other students.

Students interested in learning more about the advantages and opportunities of participating in this program should contact the College's Director for Student Professional Development and Employer Relations or the University Career Center. For details, visit [osds.uncc.edu](https://osds.uncc.edu/).

#### Domestic Internships
A number of opportunities for internships (either for-credit or not) exist for students at local and regional employers. Internships for College of Engineering students are almost always paid positions. UNC Charlotte University Career Center defines an Internship as requiring a minimum of 80 work hours which need to be completed in no less than five weeks for one semester. Fall and Spring semester internships are part-time. Summer internships may be full- or part-time. All students are eligible to apply for and accept internships posted in Hire-A-Niner.

Internships posted by the University Career Center do not routinely offer academic credit. Students can earn credit, when other options are not available, by registering for UCOL 3410 (Career Development Internship). UCOL 3410 allows Junior- and Senior-level students to earn one to three hours of elective credit, depending on criteria set by the employer and the University Career Center in consultation with the student's major department. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins the work experience.

Students interested in learning more about the advantages and opportunities of participating in this program should contact the College's Director for Student Professional Development and Employer Relations or the University Career Center. For details, visit [osds.uncc.edu](https://osds.uncc.edu/).

#### International Experiences
The College provides opportunities for overseas study, research, and/or an industrial experience. In many cases, students who meet eligibility requirements receive special scholarships and/or grants to help defray the cost of these programs.

#### Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam
The first step in professional licensure is the FE exam. Students in ABET accredited programs may take the FE Exam at any time.
