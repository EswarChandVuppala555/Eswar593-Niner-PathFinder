# Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.uncc.edu/) (ECE) provides instruction and research in areas of electrical and computer engineering such as electronics, electromagnetics, communication systems and networks, control systems, machine learning, signal and image processing, computer hardware and software, power systems, digital systems, VLSI design, embedded systems, robotics, microelectronics, optoelectronics, nanotechnology, and biomedical engineering. ECE majors take a common set of foundational courses to build basic math, science and engineering skills. Students gain experience through hands-on laboratory and design courses culminating in a senior project that combines both theory and design.

### Degree Programs

Electrical and Computer Engineering students can pursue the following degrees:

- Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.)
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S.CP.E.)
- Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (M.S.E.E.)
- Master of Science in Computer Engineering (M.S.CP.E.)
- Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering (Ph.D.)

Undergraduate students can focus on specific elective coursework to gain concentrations in Machine Learning (B.S.E.E. and B.S.CP.E.) and Power and Energy Systems (B.S.E.E. only). Undergraduates interested in post-graduate studies can qualify for the accelerated early-entry M.S. degree program. Early-entry students gain access to graduate courses during their undergraduate education whose credits double-count towards both B.S. and M.S. degrees.

Special curricula are provided for three multi-disciplinary double-major and dual-degree programs:

- Double-Major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering
- Dual Degree: Electrical Engineering and Physics
- Dual Degree: Computer Engineering and Physics

Students following the curricula for these programs can graduate in only one additional semester of coursework.

### Accreditation

Both the program in Electrical Engineering and the program in Computer Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, [www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org/).
