# Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering Concentration, B.S.M.E.

The B.S.M.E. with a Concentration in Biomedical Engineering program is intended for students interested in specialized and systematic training and education in the area of Biomedical Engineering. Students completing the requirements described in this program receive a special designation on their transcripts showing that they have completed the Concentration in Biomedical Engineering.

## Admission Requirements
***
#### Freshmen
Freshman admission is competitive. Based upon an overall evaluation of high school record with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science and SAT or ACT scores, freshmen may be admitted directly to an engineering major or as engineering undecided. 
- _Minimum GPA:_ n/a
- _Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:_ Freshmen MUST present a pre-calculus equivalent course, a math course during the high school senior year (grade 12/13) or math intensive science course such as physics or chemistry if no math courses are available, with no grades below C in any math courses. Students with AP test scores of at least 3 on AP Calculus AB or BC or early college high school students who present transfer credit for calculus equivalent to MATH 1241 or higher are exempted from having a math course in the senior year.
- _Other:_ Minimum SAT-Math score of 570 or ACT-Math subscore of 23
- _Declaration of Major:_ Students may declare the major at time of admission or at any time if in good standing with the College and University.

#### Transfers
All transfer students will be admitted to the lower division of a department, and evaluation of transfer credits follows the North Carolina articulation agreements. Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.
- _Minimum GPA:_ 2.5 (3.0 for Mechanical Engineering)
- _Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:_ Calculus I course (with grade of C or above) equivalent to MATH 1241
- _Transferable Credit Hours:_ 24

## Academic Progression Requirements
#### Freshman Year Requirements
All new freshmen, early college students, and transfer students with only one year semester at another institution are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.
- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.
- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.
- Earn at least a 2.250 GPA in the first semester.
- Complete all non-elective courses in the Freshman year curriculum with grades of C or above.
- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Complete the Freshman curriculum within three regular semesters, if starting in the required first semester mathematics course.
- Earn a 2.500 cumulative GPA upon completion of the Freshman curriculum.

#### Sophomore through Senior Year Requirements
- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.000 in the University.
- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.000 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
- Take courses in the curriculum a maximum of two times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to reenroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Readmission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for readmission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are readmitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
