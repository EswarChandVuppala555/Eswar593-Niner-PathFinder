# Fire and Safety Engineering Technology, Fire Safety Concentration, B.S.E.T.

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program include Fire Safety and Occupational Safety. Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

The Fire Safety concentration is intended for students who seek a career within the fire service. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for increasingly responsible roles in leadership and management. In addition, the program provides comprehensive classes dealing with fire behavior, active and passive protection systems as well as the foundational principles of research investigation. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Fire Safety concentration.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Progression Requirements
***
#### First-Year Requirements
All new First-Year students, including early college and dual enrolled students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.
- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.
- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.
- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.
- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year curriculum.

#### Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements
- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.
- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
- Take a course in their curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

## Special Policies or Requirements
***
Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.

#### Residence Requirements
A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.

#### Experiential Learning Requirements
All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, Senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student's transcript; students pay a course registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program.
