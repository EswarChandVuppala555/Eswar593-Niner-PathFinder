# Occupational Safety, Minor

The Occupational Safety minor is designed for students interested in the safety and environmental health professions. This minor emphasizes the technical and managerial aspects of occupational safety and health so that students will have sufficient technical skills to function in entry-level Workplace Safety/EHS roles. The minor is beneficial to majors in biology, chemistry, engineering, human resources management, organizational psychology, and public health by enabling graduates to work in safety-related roles in their professional careers.
