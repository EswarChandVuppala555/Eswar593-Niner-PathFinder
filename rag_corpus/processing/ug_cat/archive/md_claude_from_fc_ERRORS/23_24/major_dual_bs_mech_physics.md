# Physics and Mechanical Engineering, B.S. Dual Degree

The Department of Physics and Optical Science and Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science offer a dual degree designed to broaden and enhance the education of students in the mechanical engineering and physics degree programs. Students can obtain a B.S. in Physics and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering dual degree.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements

### Freshmen and Transfers
- See University Admission Requirements
- *Minimum GPA:* 2.0 (cumulative and Physics)
- *Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:* Complete the following with grades of C or above and no more than 2 attempts per course:
  - PHYS 2101
  - PHYS 2102
  - MATH 2241

### Currently Enrolled Students
- *Declaration of Major:* Engineering majors wishing to declare the B.S. in Physics degree are eligible to do so after meeting the above requirements.
  
## Degree Requirements

To obtain a dual B.S. degree in both Physics and Mechanical Engineering, undergraduate students must complete all requirements for the B.S.M.E. degree as established by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science. In addition, students must complete 12 credit hours of upper-division PHYS courses specified by the Department of Physics and Optical Science with an average grade C or above. A B.S. in Physics under this program will be awarded at the same time as or after the B.S.M.E. The B.S. in Physics degree will not be awarded in advance of the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering degree.

Students in this dual degree program are not required to fulfill the College of Science Foreign Language Requirement.
