# Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management

Engineering and technical education have undergone considerable change in the last 40 years. The complexities of space exploration, power generation, communications systems, environmental control, information processing, transportation systems, fire protection, construction management, and manufacturing have demanded a great increase in the involvement of professional engineers in theoretical and analytical work. This has resulted in a much greater emphasis upon research and development, science, and mathematics in professional engineering curricula. At the same time, after the more complex devices and systems have been engineered, their design, development, and operation require the sophisticated knowledge and skills of what might be called the "applied engineering sciences." Programs dedicated to filling this need exist all over the United States. The aim and content of these programs are distinctly different from professional engineering curricula.

To provide the appropriate distinction from both theoretical-professional engineers and from engineering technicians who are graduated from two-year community and technical colleges, the designation "engineering technologist" is employed to describe the graduates of four-year applied engineering or "engineering technology" curricula. The [Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management](http://et.charlotte.edu/) is committed to producing competent graduates that satisfy the needs of employers in North Carolina and throughout the United States.

### Degree Programs

The Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management offers curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science in Construction Management (BSCM) and the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology (BSET) degrees. In addition to the BSCM, four disciplines of study are available in Engineering Technology: Civil Engineering Technology, Electromechanical Engineering Technology, Fire and Safety Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology.

Students may enroll in the programs in several ways: 1) as freshmen; 2) as transfers without an approved Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety; 3) as a transfer after completing an Associate of Science (A.S.) or Associate in Engineering (A.E.) in a relevant engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety degree; or 4) as upper-division 2+2 transfers after completing a two-year A.A.S. degree in a relevant engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety curriculum at a community or technical college. Incoming students with an A.A.S. degree generally receive Junior class standing, with up to 64 credit hours applied toward the BSET or BSCM degree.

Construction Management and Engineering Technology students learn through applied technical courses and hands-on laboratories where they interact with experienced professors with many years of real-world engineering, design, project management, and product development experience. Graduation with a BS degree in Construction Management (BSCM) or Engineering Technology (BSET) opens the door to many exciting and challenging professional careers. Graduates choose from a variety of exciting career options where they enjoy productive professional careers with exceptional employment rates and excellent salaries.

### Accreditation

The Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Technology programs are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET. The Construction Management program is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) and the Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC) of ABET, www.abet.org.

### Employment Opportunities for Graduates

Graduates of our programs can be found in every sector of the global economy. Examples of employment opportunities and examples of recent job titles are provided below for each program.

#### Civil Engineering Technology

Civil Engineering Technology (CIET) graduates find employment in a wide range of positions in construction, surveying, engineering and architectural firms; local, state and national government; environmental and public health agencies; state departments of transportation and highways; and private business and industry. Specific job titles of recent graduates include transportation technician, highway technician, engineer-in-training, materials supervisor, surveying crew chief, civil engineering detailer/designer, office engineer, construction estimator or planner, engineering assistant, project engineer and assistant project manager.

#### Construction Management

Construction Management (CM) graduates plan, direct, and coordinate a wide variety of construction projects, including the building of all types of residential, commercial, and industrial structures, roads, bridges, wastewater treatment plants, and schools and hospitals. Construction managers may oversee an entire project or just part of a project. They often work with or for owners, engineers, architects, and others who are involved in the construction process. Construction managers evaluate and help determine appropriate construction delivery systems and the most cost-effective plan and schedule for completing the project.

#### Electromechanical Engineering Technology

Electromechanical Engineering Technology (ETEL) graduates find employment in many sectors of industry. Graduates can expect careers in robotics and automated systems, aerospace, automotive manufacturing, medical equipment and technology, electric power generation, power distribution, sustainable and renewable power, test and quality engineering, instrumentation and data acquisition, technical sales, and field engineering.

#### Fire and Safety Engineering Technology

Fire Safety graduates find employment in numerous areas associated with fire safety and protection to include prevention, suppression, building design and fire investigation and re-creation, emergency preparedness, safety analysis, and mitigation. The program stresses the importance of personal communication skills and the ability to function in a team environment. Some typical job titles of recent graduates include firefighter, fire investigator, fire prevention officer, fire inspector, fire captain, and safety coordinator.

Occupational Safety graduates find employment in various industries such as construction, industrial/manufacturing plants, academic/university EHS, government offices (regulatory and non-regulatory), and military bases as safety professionals or Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) professionals. Students in the program will learn how to recognize, evaluate, and control the workplace hazards that are found in many different industries.

#### Mechanical Engineering Technology

Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) graduates use the principles of energy, materials, and mechanics to design, build, test and maintain a wide variety of machines, processes, and systems with employment in the automotive, aerospace, energy, and other high-tech industries. METs work in areas such as computer-aided design, plant production or maintenance, research and development, or as laboratory technicians, production assistants, manufacturing or quality control engineers, product and materials testing technologists, or applications engineers.

### Engineering Technology and Construction Management Program Educational Objectives and Outcomes

### Additional Programs and Opportunities

#### Distance Education

In addition to the on-campus programs, the upper division of the BSET program in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (Fire Safety concentration) is offered online to part-time students. This allows students who already hold an approved degree to complete their Junior and Senior years of the BSET program at a distance. Estimated completion time for the distance delivery of the Junior and Senior years is approximately four years, including summers, since students generally take two courses per semester.
