**Engineering Programs**

The Baccalaureate programs in engineering offer professional engineering
education that can be used as the foundation for different career
objectives: workforce ready professional engineers in industry,
business, or consulting; graduate study preparing for careers in
research, development, or teaching; and a more general and liberal
engineering education with the objective of keeping a variety of career
paths open.  

The course of study includes the humanities, social sciences, physical
sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences and design.  The student
expecting to accept employment in industry may emphasize the engineering
design and engineering science aspects of a program, while the student
preparing for graduate study might emphasize the mathematics and science
aspects.  Some graduates take on executive and management
responsibilities in industries and firms that are based upon engineering
products and services.  These students may choose to construct an
elective option in their program to include economics and
business-related courses that strengthen their communications and other
non-technical skills.

Engineering students are strongly encouraged to pursue the requirements
for registration as a Professional Engineer (PE).  The first step in the
registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of
Engineering (FE) Examination.  Students are encouraged to take this
examination during their Senior year.  Additional requirements for
professional licensure subsequent to graduation include the accumulation
of at least four-years of progressive engineering experience and
successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE
Exam).  Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who
complete their master's degree only need three years of progressive
engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North
Carolina.

All program-level Admission and Progression Requirements are in addition
to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admissions

mathematics and natural sciences gained through higher education,
experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and
extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity. 
Engineering technology education focuses on the applied aspects of
science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in the
technological spectrum closest to product improvement, manufacturing,
construction, and engineering operational functions.

Engineering technology programs are characterized by a focus on
application and practice with an approximately equal mix of theory,
practice, and laboratory experience.  

Graduates of the engineering technology programs are recruited by most
major technological companies in the U.S.  They are employed across the
technological spectrum but are best suited to areas that deal with
application, implementation, production, and construction.  Technical
sales and customer service fields also account for many placements.

Engineering technology students are encouraged to pursue the
requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer.  The first
step in the registration process is the successful completion of the
Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination.  Students are encouraged
to take this examination during their Senior year.  Additional
requirements for professional licensure following graduation include the
accumulation of at least eight years of progressive experience and
successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE
Exam).  Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who
complete their master's degree only need seven years of progressive
engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North

**Unrestricted Elective Courses**

As needed to complete the credit hours required for graduation.

**Degree Total = 120 Credit Hours**

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, early college students, and transfer
students with only one semester at another institution are initially
advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students
must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the
curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of
  C or above. Core courses include:: MATH 1241 and MATH 1242, PHYS 2101;
  CHEM 1251 or MEGR 1100 (MEGR majors); MATH 2164 and ECGR 2103
  (CPGR/EEGR Majors); MATH 2164 (SEGR Majors).

- Pass all courses within two attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.50 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

> withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Concentrations**

The B.S.C.E. degree is also available with optional Concentrations in
Energy Infrastructure, Environmental/Water Resources Engineering,
Geotechnical Engineering, Land Development Engineering, Structures, and
Transportation. See the following individual listings for each.

**Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (B.S.C.E.) *with
Concentration in Energy Infrastructure***

The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (B.S.C.E.) with a
Concentration in Energy Infrastructure requires a minimum of 120 credit
hours. The Concentration in Energy Infrastructure is intended for
students interested in a specialized focus in energy as it relates to
civil engineering, infrastructure, and environmental issues related to
the development, generation, and distribution of energy.

Through careful course selection and scheduling, students can obtain the
Concentration in Energy Infrastructure within the required 120-hour
B.S.C.E. curriculum. Students completing the requirements described in
this program receive a special designation on their transcripts showing
they have completed the Concentration in Energy Infrastructure.

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

of the program of interest make decisions on a student's eligibility to
pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student\'s
entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A
record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such
decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a
change of major to a given program, they will be required to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.

- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit
the ETCM department at
https://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors for more
information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the
major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM
program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the
given program.

**Degree Requirements**

> withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Bachelor of Science**

**in Environmental Engineering (B.S.)**

Coursework combines training in the core subject matter of Environmental
Engineering with design experience that runs throughout the curriculum,
students will have opportunities to assess, analyze, and solve
real-world and locally relevant problems related to contamination of
soils, water, and the atmosphere.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in
addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission
Requirements.

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, early college students, and transfer
students with only one semester at another institution are initially
advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students
must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the
curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of
  C or above. Core courses include: MATH 1241 and 1242, PHYS 2101; CHEM
  1251 or MEGR 1100 (MEGR majors); MATH 2164 and ECGR 2103 (CPGR/EEGR
  Majors); MATH 2164 (SEGR Majors).

- Pass all courses within two attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.50 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S.CP.E.) *with
Concentration in Machine Learning***

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S.CP.E.) with
Concentration in Machine Learning is intended for students interested in
extra training in topics related to the theory, design, and synthesis of
intelligent machines with an emphasis on design of machines capable of
autonomously learning rules that enable these machines to adapt their
behavior from observed measurements. The plan of study for the B.S.CP.E.
with Concentration in Machine Learning is similar to the B.S.CP.E. plan
of study with the following primary exception:

Students pursuing the B.S.CP.E. with Concentration in Machine Learning
are required to enroll in approved Machine Learning Technical Electives,
usually during the Junior and Senior year, to complete their degree
requirements.

Through careful course selection and scheduling, students can obtain the
Concentration in Machine Learning within the required 120 credit hour
B.S.CP.E. curriculum. Students completing the requirements described in
this program receive a special designation on their transcripts showing
they have completed the Concentration in Machine Learning.

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, early college students, and transfer
students with only one semester at another institution are initially
advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students
must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the
curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of
  C or above. Core courses include: MATH 1241 and 1242, PHYS 2101; CHEM
  1251 or MEGR 1100 (MEGR majors); MATH 2164 and ECGR 2103 (CPGR/EEGR
  Majors); MATH 2164 (SEGR Majors).

- Pass all courses within two attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.50 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

> withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.) *with
Concentration in Machine Learning***

The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.) with
Concentration in Machine Learning is intended for students interested in
extra training in topics related to the theory, design and synthesis of
intelligent machines with an emphasis on design of machines capable of
autonomously learning rules that enable these machines to adapt their
behavior from observed measurements. The plan of study for the B.S.E.E.
with Concentration in Machine Learning is similar to the BSEE plan of
study with the following primary exception:

Students pursuing the B.S.E.E. with Concentration in Machine Learning
are required to enroll in approved Machine Learning Technical Electives,
usually during the Junior and Senior year, to complete their degree
requirements.

Through careful course selection and scheduling, students can obtain the
Concentration in Machine Learning within the required 120 credit hour
B.S.E.E. curriculum. Students completing the requirements described in
this program receive a special designation on their transcripts showing
they have completed the Concentration in Machine Learning.

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

**Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major**

Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have
not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are
not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives
of the program of interest make decisions on a student's eligibility to
pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student\'s
entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A
record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such
decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a
change of major to a given program, they will be required to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.

- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).

- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at
  least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.

**Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of
Major**

Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to
Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet
major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit
the ETCM department at
http://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors for more
information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the
major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM

Engineering and technical education have undergone considerable change
in the last 40 years. The complexities of space exploration, power
generation, communications systems, environmental control, information
processing, transportation systems, fire protection, construction
management, and manufacturing have demanded a great increase in the
involvement of professional engineers in theoretical and analytical
work. This has resulted in a much greater emphasis upon research and
development, science, and mathematics in professional engineering
curricula. At the same time, after the more complex devices and systems
have been engineered, their design, development, and operation require
the sophisticated knowledge and skills of what might be called the
\"applied engineering sciences.\" Programs dedicated to filling this
need exist all over the United States. The aim and content of these
programs are distinctly different from professional engineering
curricula.

To provide the appropriate distinction from both
theoretical-professional engineers and from engineering technicians who
are graduated from two-year community and technical colleges, the
designation \"engineering technologist\" is employed to describe the
graduates of four-year applied engineering or \"engineering technology\"
curricula. The Department of Engineering Technology and Construction
Management is committed to producing competent graduates that satisfy
the needs of employers in North Carolina and throughout the United
States.

All program-level Admission and Progression Requirements are in addition
to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admissions
Requirements.

**Degree Programs**

The Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management
offers curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science in Construction
Management (BSCM) and the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology
(BSET) degrees. In addition to the BSCM, four disciplines of study are
available in Engineering Technology: Civil Engineering Technology,
Electromechanical Engineering Technology, Fire and Safety Engineering
Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology.

Students may enroll in the programs in several ways: 1) as First-Year
students; 2) as transfers without an approved Associate of Applied
Science (A.A.S.) degree in engineering technology, construction
management, or fire safety; as a transfer after completing an Associate
of Science (A.S.)  or Associate in Engineering (A.E.) in a relevant
engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety degree;
or 4) as upper-division 2+2 transfers after completing a two-year A.A.S.
degree in a relevant engineering technology, construction management, or
fire safety curriculum at a community or technical college. Incoming
students with an A.A.S. degree generally receive Junior class standing,
with up to 64 credit hours applied toward the BSET or BSCM degree.

Construction Management and Engineering Technology students learn
through applied technical courses and hands-on laboratories where they
interact with experienced professors with many years of real-world
engineering, design, project management, and product development
experience. Graduation with a B.S. degree in Construction Management
(BSCM) or Engineering Technology (BSET) opens the door to many exciting
and challenging professional careers. Graduates choose from a variety of
exciting career options where they enjoy productive professional careers
with exceptional employment rates and excellent salaries.

Accreditation

The Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Technology programs
are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission
(ETAC) of ABET. The Construction Management program is accredited by the

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, including early college and dual enrolled
students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are
initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering.
Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in
the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of
  C or above. Core courses include:: ETCE 1104, ETCE 1222, ETCE 1211 and
  ETCE 1211L, CMET 2105, CMET 1680, in addition to ETGR 1201 and the
  First-Year science and math requirements.

- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Take a course in their curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve
  a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a
  grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Special Policies or Requirements**

Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative
education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate
research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a
career-related position for professional experience.  A minimum of 80
work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the
program.  Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time.  Summer 49erships may
be full- or part-time.  Full-time students who are in good University
standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.0 minimum
cumulative GPA are eligible.  Internships do not offer academic credit,
but are noted on the student\'s transcript; students pay a course
registration fee.  Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the
student begins a work experience.  Students may begin this program
during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit
hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program. For more
information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student
Development and Success or the University Career Center.

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, including early college and dual enrolled
students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are
initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering.
Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in
the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, including early college and dual enrolled
students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are
initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering.
Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in
the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the

**Grade Requirements**

\*Note: Courses marked with \* must be completed with a grade of C or
above.

**Degree Total = 120 Credit Hours**

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

All First-Year students, early college students, and transfer students
with only one semester at another institution are initially advised by a
central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy
the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and
matriculate to their major department.   

-  Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

-  Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements

> of their program.

-  Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

-  Complete all core courses in the first-year curriculum with grades

> of C or above. Core courses include: ETME 1111, ETME 1112, in
>
> addition to ETGR 1201, and the First-Year science and math
> requirements.

-  Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the first-year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the

> departmental curriculum.  Failure to meet this requirement for two
> consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
> College of Engineering courses.

- Take courses in the curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a
  satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade
  of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering.  If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department.  Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Special Policies or Requirements**

Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to
64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology
degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree
programs at UNC Charlotte.

**Residence Requirements**

A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and
the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy
residence requirements.

**Experiential Learning Requirements**

All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential
courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education,
internships, Senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a
career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80
work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the
program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may
be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University
standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum
cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit,
but are noted on the student\'s transcript; students pay a course
registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the
student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during
their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at
UNC Charlotte before applying to the program. For more information,
contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and
Success or the University Career Center.

**BSET in Mechanical Engineering Technology *with Concentration in
Applied Energy***

A Concentration in Applied Energy is available to BSET in Mechanical
Engineering Technology students.

**Admission Requirements**

Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of
Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year
students or as transfer students.

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

Mechanical engineering is possibly the broadest of the engineering
disciplines. Mechanical engineers are involved in almost all aspects of
the technological problems facing today\'s society. Among the major
concerns of the mechanical engineer are problems related to conversion,
utilization, and conservation of our limited energy resources.
Additional important areas for the mechanical engineer include the
design and analysis of machines, structures, and manufacturing processes
related to the industrial output of the nation. Increasingly, this
design and analysis is computer-based using the techniques of
computer-aided design (CAD/CAM).

A sound understanding of engineering sciences is fundamental to the
education of engineers in every discipline. Engineering sciences are
generally identified as those areas of engineering that emphasize the
application of the fundamental principles of the physical sciences,
primarily physics and chemistry, to engineering problems. Some classical
and emerging engineering areas that fall within this field include
thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, engineering mechanics, engineering
materials, nuclear and chemical sciences, microelectronics theory and
fabrication, manufacturing, metrology, and the solid state sciences.

All program-level Admission and Progression Requirements are in addition
to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admissions
Requirements.

Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (M.S.M.E.), and Doctor of
Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. Additionally, a dual bachelor's degree
program is offered in cooperation with the Department of Physics. Using
the flexibility provided by the technical electives, and with
engineering career counseling, a student can develop a variety of
educational programs that would provide the background for professional
engineering licensing and practice in any of the areas included within
mechanical engineering and/or the engineering sciences. Students can
also prepare for graduate study in mechanical engineering, materials
science, or any of the recognized areas covered by the engineering
sciences. Individualized study programs in one of the interdisciplinary
fields involving the merger of engineering and the various science
areas, such as bioengineering, microelectronics, or chemical engineering
sciences, can be developed.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

> withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.) *with
Concentration in Biomedical Engineering***

The B.S.M.E. with a Concentration in Biomedical Engineering program is
intended for students interested in specialized and systematic training
and education in the area of Biomedical Engineering. Students completing
the requirements described in this program receive a special designation
on their transcripts showing that they have completed the Concentration
in Biomedical Engineering.

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in

application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to reenroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is
accepted by the College of Engineering.  If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Readmission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An
application for readmission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department.  Students who are readmitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

healthcare and airlines, at all levels from an entry position to top
management. This wide applicability, along with a very strong focus to
model, analyze and manage complex engineered systems with proven tools
and techniques are the primary strengths of SE. Practically every
organization requires Systems Engineers to identify, characterize, and
solve the right problems and to eliminate inefficiencies and root-causes
that generate these problems.

All program-level Admission and Progression Requirements are in addition
to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admissions
Requirements.

**Degree Programs**

The department offers a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering
(BSSE) degree and a Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM)
degree. For information about the master\'s program, see the *UNC
Charlotte Graduate Catalog*.

flexibility for study in specific areas. Each student may design a
technical elective program with his or her advisor's approval in order
to achieve individual goals and follow a desired track.

Qualified students may apply for Early Entry into the graduate program
in Engineering Management during their Junior or Senior year. If
accepted, students may take optional courses for graduate credit and
begin work on their master\'s degree while completing their
undergraduate degree.

**Student Outcomes**

Upon graduation, our students will have:

1)  An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and
    engineering to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
    problems.

2)  An ability to apply the engineering design process to create thermal
    or mechanical systems that meet specified application goals with
    consideration for public health, safety, and welfare, as well as

3)  An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
    through oral and technical writing.

4)  An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in
    engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must
    consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic,
    environmental, and societal contexts.

5)  A record of productive participation as team members or in
    leadership roles on multidisciplinary teams which create a
    collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan
    tasks, and meet objectives.

6)  An ability to develop experimental protocols and perform experiments
    designed to test or verify mechanical principles, components, and
    properties; analyze results; interpret data; and use engineering
    judgment to draw conclusions.

**Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering (B.S.S.E.)**

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).

**Additional Technical Elective Courses (12 credit hours)**

BSSE students can pursue an optional Concentration in Energy Systems.
Students who are not enrolled in a concentration are considered
undeclared and select four additional Systems Engineering Technical
Elective courses from the list above to fulfill their BSSE degree
requirements. Any elective course listed above at the 3000- or
4000-level may be taken. However, these elective courses cannot be used
to fulfill both the Technical Elective requirements and the Additional
Technical Elective requirements (i.e., no double counting of course
credit hours toward the BSSE degree). Please note that many of these
courses may also have prerequisites.

**Unrestricted Elective Courses**

As needed to complete the credit hours required for graduation.

**Degree Total = 120 credit hours**

**Progression Requirements**

**First-Year Requirements**

All new First-Year students, early college students, and transfer
students with only one semester at another institution are initially
advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students
must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the
curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.

- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of
  their program.

- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.

- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of
  C or above. Core courses include: MATH 1241 and MATH 1242, PHYS 2101;
  CHEM 1251 or MEGR 1100 (MEGR majors); MATH 2164 and ECGR 2103
  (CPGR/EEGR Majors); MATH 2164 (SEGR Majors).

- Pass all courses within two attempts, including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.

- Earn a 2.50 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year
  curriculum.

**Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements**

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.

- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the
  departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two
  consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in
  College of Engineering courses.

- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including

withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the
progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the
conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be
ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal
is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted,
requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual
situation are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is mutually
agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow
University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of
Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An
application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by
the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of
Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements
for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.
These requirements are specified in a \"Continuation Agreement\" that is
mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate
advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the
agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these
consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the
requirements will automatically result in the student not being
permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

**Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering (B.S.S.E.) *with
Concentration in Energy Systems***

**Admission Requirements**

**First-Year Students**

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of
the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in
math and science. See University Admission Requirements ​for a detailed
description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their
application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year
College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called
the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having
completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm
their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This
selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other
engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

**Transfers**

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a
departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the
evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina
articulation agreements).  

- See University Admission Requirements​  

- Minimum GPA:  2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)

- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  

<!-- -->

- Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to MATH 1241),
  with a grade of C or above

- Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to
  MATH 1103) or higher, with a grade of C or above

<!-- -->

- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24

Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not

meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the
chair of the major department.

**Currently Enrolled Students**

In order to remain in the concentration, a minimum overall GPA of 3.0
must be maintained.

**Changes of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering**

First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major
from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required
to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.

- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from
  a course with a grade of W.

- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).

**Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major**

- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.

- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the
  program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to
  elevate the GPA.

- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.

- May request authorization to enroll in ENGR 1201, ETGR 1201 or ETGR
  1101 via a UCOL advisor or via a request to the College of Engineering
  Advising department, if not in UCOL.

- May request authorization to enroll in ENGR 1202 via a UCOL advisor or
  via a request to an advisor in the program of interest, if not in
  UCOL.

**Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major**

Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have
not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are
not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives
of the program of interest make decisions on a student's eligibility to
pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student\'s
entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A
record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such
decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a
change of major to a given program, they will be required to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.

- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a
  course with a grade of W.

- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).

  least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.

**Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of
Major**

Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to
Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet
major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit
the ETCM department at
http://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors for more
information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the
major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM
program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the
given program.
