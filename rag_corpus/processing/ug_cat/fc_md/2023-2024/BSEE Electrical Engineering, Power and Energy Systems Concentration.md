| * * * |

Students pursuing the [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9922) (BSEE) degree may choose to add a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems. The plan of study for the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems is similar to the BSEE plan of study with three primary exceptions:

1. All BSEE students are required to complete Technical Elective courses, usually during the Junior and Senior year. Students pursuing the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems are required to enroll in approved Power and Energy Technical Electives only. _See required courses below._
2. During the Senior year, Power and Energy Systems Concentration students must complete an intensive, two-semester energy-related Senior design project.
3. Students in the concentration are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam prior to graduation.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045). |

above prior to enrolling in any Junior-level courses.  In order to remain in the concentration, students must maintain a minimum (overall and program) GPA of 3.00.  A GPA in the major and overall GPA of 3.00 or above is also required to graduate.<br>#### Changes of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering<br>First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>#### Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.<br>- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.<br>- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9923#tt7715), [ETGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9923#tt3406) or [ETGR 1101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9923#tt5478) via a UCOL advisor or via a request to the [College of Engineering Advising

Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student’s eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student’s entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.<br>#### Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit the [ETCM Department webpage](https://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors) for more information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the given program.<br>## Degree
