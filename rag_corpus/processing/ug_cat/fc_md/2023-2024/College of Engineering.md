natural sciences gained through higher education, experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity.  Engineering technology education focuses on the applied aspects of science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in the technological spectrum closest to product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions.<br>Engineering technology programs are characterized by a focus on application and practice with an approximately equal mix of theory, practice, and laboratory experience.  <br>Graduates of the engineering technology programs are recruited by most major technological companies in the U.S.  They are employed across the technological spectrum but are best suited to areas that deal with application, implementation, production, and construction.  Technical sales and customer service fields also account for many placements.<br>Engineering technology students are encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer.  The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination.  Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year.  Additional requirements for professional licensure following graduation include the accumulation of at least eight years of progressive experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam).  Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master’s degree only need seven years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina. <br>#### Majors<br>- [Civil Engineering Technology,
