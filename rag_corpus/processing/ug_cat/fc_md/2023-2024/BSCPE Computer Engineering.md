| * * * |

A Major in Computer Engineering leading to the B.S.CP.E. degree consists of 120 credit hours.

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S.CP.E.) degree has a very structured curriculum.  An eight-semester sequence of courses at more than a full-time load forms the core of the curriculum to develop the concepts and design and analysis techniques fundamental to the various areas of specialization.  This program should be initiated early while at UNC Charlotte.  Beginning the program late or after transferring from another institution will likely delay completion within 4 years.

Emphasis is placed on the utilization of computers throughout the curricula.  Graduates have a wide range of job opportunities as power engineers, communication engineers, digital design engineers, test engineers, embedded system developers, network engineers, control engineers, project engineers, robotic system engineers, optoelectronic engineers, application engineers, analog engineers, medical product engineers, and process engineers.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>#### First-Year Students<br>First-Year admission is competitive. Based upon an overall evaluation of high school record with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science and SAT or ACT scores, First-Year students may be admitted directly to an engineering major or as engineering undecided. <br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045) ​<br>- _Minimum GPA:_ n/a<br>- _Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:_  First-Year students MUST present a pre-calculus equivalent course, a math course during the high school senior year (grade 12/13) or math intensive science course such as physics or chemistry if no math courses are available, with no grades below C in any math courses.  Students with AP test scores of at least 3 on AP Calculus AB or BC or early college high school students who present transfer credit for calculus equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt3161) or higher are exempted from having a math course in the senior year.<br>- Minimum SAT-Math score of 570 or ACT-Math subscore of 23<br>- ​ _Declaration of Major_:  Students may declare the major at time of admission or at any time if in good standing with the College and University.<br>#### Transfers<br>All transfer students will be admitted to the lower division of a department, and evaluation of transfer credits follows the North Carolina articulation agreements.  Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045) ​ <br>- _Minimum GPA:_ 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering)<br>- _Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:_  Calculus I course (with grade of C or above) equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt8439)<br>- _Transferable Credit Hours:_ 24<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>#### Changes of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering<br>First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>#### Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.<br>- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.<br>- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt5681), [ETGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt6471) or [ETGR 1101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt8872) via a UCOL advisor or via a request to the [College of Engineering Advising department](http://engr.charlotte.edu/advising), if not in UCOL.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1202](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=9924#tt888) via a UCOL advisor or via a request to an advisor in the program of interest, if not in UCOL.<br>#### Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student’s eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student’s entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.<br>#### Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit the [ETCM department webpage](https://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors) for more information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the given program.<br>## Degree
