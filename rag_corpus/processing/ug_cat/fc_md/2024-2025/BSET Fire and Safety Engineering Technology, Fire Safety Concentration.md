| * * * |

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program include Fire Safety and [Occupational Safety](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=11087).  Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

The Fire Safety concentration is intended for students who seek a career within the fire service. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for increasingly responsible roles in leadership and management. In addition, the program provides comprehensive classes dealing with fire behavior, active and passive protection systems as well as the foundational principles of research investigation. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Fire Safety concentration.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461). |
