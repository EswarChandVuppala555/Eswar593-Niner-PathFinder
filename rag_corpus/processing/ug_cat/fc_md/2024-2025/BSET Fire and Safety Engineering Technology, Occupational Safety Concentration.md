| * * * |

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program include [Fire Safety](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10717) and Occupational Safety.  Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

Occupational safety is a career path where professionals recognize, evaluate, and control workplace hazards, which exist in almost every industry. Building on a strong background in the life and physical sciences, students learn about fire prevention/protection, environmental pollution control, industrial hazards, industrial hygiene (industrial health), and ergonomics in this multi-disciplinary program. An experiential capstone experience (internship, co-op, or a supervised directed project) is required. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Occupational Safety concentration.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year students or as transfer students.<br>#### First-Year Students<br>Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general University admission requirements. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461).<br>#### Transfers<br>See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461).<br>Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:<br>1. Transfer applicants who do not have the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.<br>2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:<br>- Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter.  Acceptable AAS degrees may include: Fire Protection, Fire Science, or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department.  A minimum GPA of 2.50 (out of 4.00) in the AAS degree is required.<br>- Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter. Missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Occupational Safety must first satisfy the following requirements in order to be considered eligible for admission:<br>- Complete [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=11087#tt9954) or higher with a grade of C or better.<br>- Earn a minimum 2.20 cumulative GPA.<br>- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is passed within three attempts.<br>- Complete at least one Occupational Safety course in the curriculum. This course will be selected by the Program Director and the Academic Advisor on a case-by-case basis. <br>Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission by submitting the [Change of Major Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>- Take a course in their curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.<br>An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering.  If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.<br>A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department.  Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.  These requirements are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>## Special Policies or Requirements<br>* * *<br>Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only.  These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.<br>#### Residence Requirements<br>A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.<br>#### Experiential Learning Requirements<br>All students must complete an experiential learning course.  Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, Senior design projects, or undergraduate research.<br>Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience.  A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program.  Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time.  Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time.  Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible.  Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student’s transcript; students pay a course registration fee.  Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience.  Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program.  For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center. |
