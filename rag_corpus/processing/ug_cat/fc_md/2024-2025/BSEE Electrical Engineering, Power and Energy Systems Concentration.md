| * * * |

Students pursuing the [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10709) (BSEE) degree may choose to add a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems. The plan of study for the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems is similar to the BSEE plan of study with three primary exceptions:

1. All BSEE students are required to complete Technical Elective courses, usually during the Junior and Senior year. Students pursuing the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems are required to enroll in approved Power and Energy Technical Electives only. _See required courses below._
2. During the Senior year, Power and Energy Systems Concentration students must complete an intensive, two-semester energy-related Senior design project.
3. Students in the concentration are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam prior to graduation.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>#### First-Year Students<br>First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461) ​for a detailed description of the criteria.<br>First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.<br>#### Transfers<br>All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).  <br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=4461) ​  <br>- Minimum GPA:  2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)<br>- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  <br>  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt9992)), with a grade of C or above<br>  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt6902)) or higher, with a grade of C or above<br>- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24<br>Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>Students must apply for admission and may enter the Concentration in Power and Energy Systems program after successfully completing the first-year engineering curriculum.  Additionally, an overall GPA of 2.50 is required for admission into the Concentration in Power and Energy Systems. <br>All non-elective first year courses must be completed with C or above prior to enrolling in any Junior-level courses.  In order to remain in the concentration, students must maintain a minimum (overall and program) GPA of 3.00.  A GPA in the major and overall GPA of 3.00 or above is also required to graduate.<br>#### Changes of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering<br>First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>#### Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.<br>- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.<br>- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt7510), [ETGR 1201](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt860) or [ETGR 1101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt6461) via a UCOL advisor or via a request to the [College of Engineering Advising Department](http://engr.charlotte.edu/advising), if not in UCOL.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1202](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10710#tt2716) via a UCOL advisor or via a request to an advisor in the program of interest, if not in UCOL.<br>#### Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student’s eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student’s entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:<br>- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.<br>#### Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit the [ETCM Department webpage](https://et.charlotte.edu/prospective-students/change-majors) for more information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the given program.<br>## Degree Requirements<br>* * *<br>### General Education Courses (31-32 credit hours)<br>* * *<br>For details on required general education courses, refer to the [General Education Program](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=10902). Total hours to satisfy General Education Requirements may vary as some general education requirements may be double-counted in the major with departmental approval.

Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department.  Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses. |
