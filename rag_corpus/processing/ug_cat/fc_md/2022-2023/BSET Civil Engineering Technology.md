| * * * |

Civil Engineering Technology includes computer-aided drafting (CAD); structures (analysis, design of structural steel and reinforced concrete); construction (cost estimating, construction planning and administration); transportation (surveying, highway design and construction); water resources (hydraulics, hydrology, and environmental); and geotechnical (soil mechanics, foundations and earthwork).

The Civil Engineering Technology program shares a common curriculum with the Construction Management program for the first two years.  Students may move between the common programs until the Junior year when the curricula diverge.  At the end of the Sophomore year, students must select either the analysis and design-oriented Civil Engineering Technology BSET degree or the management-oriented BSCM program.

AAS transfer students from approved programs receive 64 credit hours for the AAS degree; thus, AAS students need only to complete the upper-division portion of the courses listed below and remediate any entrance deficiencies noted upon matriculation. |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as freshmen or as transfer students.<br>#### Freshmen<br>Applicants entering as Freshmen must meet the general University admission requirements.<br>#### Transfers<br>Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:<br>1) Transfer applicants not having the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.<br>2) Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:<br>a) Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter.  Acceptable AAS degrees may include Architectural, Automation, Building Construction, Civil, Construction, Computer, Controls, Design and Drafting, Electrical, Electronics, Environmental, Fire Protection, Fire Science, Industrial, Instrumentation, Manufacturing, Mechanical, Optics, Robotics, Surveying or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department.  A minimum GPA of 2.5 (out of 4.0) in the AAS degree is required.<br>b) Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter (missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte).<br>Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only.  These credit hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.<br>## Residence Requirements<br>A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.<br>## Experiential Learning Requirements<br>All students must complete an experiential learning course.  Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate research.<br>Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience.  A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program.  Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time.  Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time.  Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible.  Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student’s transcript; students pay a course registration fee.  Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience.  Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year; transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before making application for the program.  For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.<br>## Course Requirements<br>Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.<br>- **Entering Freshmen:**  Students admitted as Freshmen complete the appropriate four year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.<br>- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree:**  Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four year curriculum that they were admitted into after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.<br>- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree:**  Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded.  Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.<br>## Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers<br>Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:<br>- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)<br>- Pre-calculus (3 credit hours)<br>- Differential and Integral Calculus (6 credit hours)<br>- General Physics (with lab) (4 credit hours)<br>- Additional Physics (with lab) or Geology (3-4 credit hours)<br>- Technical Courses in Major Area (up to 41 credit hours)<br>  - ET Computer Applications<br>  - Computer-Aided Drafting<br>  - Construction Surveying<br>  - Statics<br>  - Strength of Materials<br>  - Construction Materials with Lab<br>  - Construction Methods<br>  - Hydraulics or hydrology or environmental technology<br>  - Building Information Modeling<br>  - Plan Reading and Quantity Takeoffs<br>## Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students<br>In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year.  Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.<br>## Academic Progression Requirements<br>#### Freshman Year Requirements<br>All new freshmen, including early college and dual enrolled students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.<br>- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.<br>- Follow all prerequisite, co-requisite, and progression requirements of their program.<br>- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the Freshman curriculum.<br>#### Sophomore through Senior Year Requirements<br>- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.000 in the University.<br>- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.000 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>- Take a course in their curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.<br>An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to reenroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering.  If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.  A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Readmission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An application for readmission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department.  Students who are readmitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.  These requirements are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>## Degree Requirements (4-Year Program)<br>* * *<br>The BSET in Civil Engineering Technology program consists of 120 credit hours. <br>###
