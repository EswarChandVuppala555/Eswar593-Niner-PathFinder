* * *

The [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.uncc.edu/) (ECE) provides instruction and research in areas of electrical and computer engineering such as electronics, electromagnetics, communication systems and networks, control systems, machine learning, signal and image processing, computer hardware and software, power systems, digital systems, VLSI design, embedded systems, robotics, microelectronics, optoelectronics, nanotechnology, and biomedical engineering.  ECE majors take a common set of foundational courses to build basic math, science and engineering skills.  Students gain experience through hands-on laboratory and design courses culminating in a senior project that combines both theory and design.  The ECE M.S. and Ph.D. graduate programs are designed for graduates and professionals who wish to enhance their knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics in ECE.  These programs provide advanced knowledge and research experience in a chosen area of electrical and computer engineering.

### Degree Programs

Electrical and Computer Engineering students can pursue the following degrees:

- Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.)
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S.CP.E.)
- Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (M.S.E.E.)
- Master of Science in Computer Engineering (M.S.CP.E.)
- Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering (Ph.D.)

Undergraduate students can focus on specific elective coursework to gain concentrations in Machine Learning (B.S.E.E. and B.S.CP.E.) and Power and Energy Systems (B.S.E.E. only).  Undergraduates interested in post-graduate studies can qualify for the accelerated early-entry M.S. degree program.  Early-entry students gain access to graduate courses during their undergraduate education whose credits double-count towards both B.S. and M.S. degrees.

Special curricula are provided for three multi-disciplinary double-major and dual-degree programs:

- Double-Major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering
- Dual Degree: Electrical Engineering and Physics
- Dual Degree: Computer Engineering and Physics

Students following the curricula for these programs can graduate in only one additional semester of coursework.

### Accreditation

The B.S. Electrical Engineering and B.S. Computer Engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, [www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org/).

### B.S.CP.E./B.S.E.E. Program Educational Objectives

Our graduates are expected to achieve:

1. Successful careers in industry and/or success in post-baccalaureate studies as evidenced by:
   - Being valuable contributors to their employers
   - Career satisfaction
   - Professional visibility through publications, presentations, recognitions, and awards
   - Promotions in their chosen professions
   - Advanced degrees earned
2. Abilities to contribute to the betterment of society and the world as evidenced by:
   - Good citizenship by engaging in engineering practice that values integrity and ethical conduct
   - Useful inventions
   - Entrepreneurial activities
   - Active involvement in the education of others, locally or globally

### B.S.CP.E./B.S.E.E. Student Outcomes

The B.S. in Computer Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering programs have documented student outcomes that support the program educational objectives. Attainment of these outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering. These student outcomes are evidenced by the ability to:

1. Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
2. Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
3. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
4. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
5. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
6. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
7. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
