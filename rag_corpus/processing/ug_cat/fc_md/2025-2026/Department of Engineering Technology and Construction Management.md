Engineering and technical education have undergone considerable change in the last 40 years. The complexities of space exploration, power generation, communications systems, environmental control, information processing, transportation systems, fire protection, construction management, and manufacturing have demanded a great increase in the involvement of professional engineers in theoretical and analytical work. This has resulted in a much greater emphasis upon research and development, science, and mathematics in professional engineering curricula. At the same time, after the more complex devices and systems have been engineered, their design, development, and operation require the sophisticated knowledge and skills of what might be called the “applied engineering sciences.” Programs dedicated to filling this need exist all over the United States. The aim and content of these programs are distinctly different from professional engineering curricula.

To provide the appropriate distinction from both theoretical-professional engineers and from engineering technicians who are graduated from two-year community and technical colleges, the designation “engineering technologist” is employed to describe the graduates of four-year applied engineering or “engineering technology” curricula. The [Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management](http://et.charlotte.edu/) is committed to producing competent graduates that satisfy the needs of employers in North Carolina and throughout the United States.

### Degree Programs

The Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management offers curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science in Construction Management (BSCM) and the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology (BSET) degrees.  In addition to the BSCM, four disciplines of study are available in Engineering Technology:  Civil Engineering Technology, Electromechanical Engineering Technology, Fire and Safety Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology.

Students may enroll in the programs in several ways:  1) as freshmen; 2) as transfers without an approved Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety; 3) as a transfer after completing an Associate of Science (A.S.)  or Associate in Engineering (A.E.) in a relevant engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety degree; or 4) as upper-division 2+2 transfers after completing a two-year A.A.S. degree in a relevant engineering technology, construction management, or fire safety curriculum at a community or technical college.  Incoming students with an A.A.S. degree generally receive Junior class standing, with up to 64 credit hours applied toward the BSET or BSCM degree.

Construction Management and Engineering Technology students learn through applied technical courses and hands-on laboratories where they interact with experienced professors with many years of real-world engineering, design, project management, and product development experience. Graduation with a BS degree in Construction Management (BSCM) or Engineering Technology (BSET) opens the door to many exciting and challenging professional careers. Graduates choose from a variety of exciting career options where they enjoy productive professional careers with exceptional employment rates and excellent salaries.

### Accreditation

The Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Technology programs are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET.  The Construction Management program is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) and the Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC) of ABET, www.abet.org.
