Mechanical engineering is possibly the broadest of the engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers are involved in almost all aspects of the technological problems facing today’s society. Among the major concerns of the mechanical engineer are problems related to conversion, utilization, and conservation of our limited energy resources. Additional important areas for the mechanical engineer include the design and analysis of machines, structures, and manufacturing processes related to the industrial output of the nation. Increasingly, this design and analysis is computer based using the techniques of computer-aided design (CAD/CAM).

A sound understanding of engineering sciences is fundamental to the education of engineers in every discipline. Engineering sciences are generally identified as those areas of engineering that emphasize the application of the fundamental principles of the physical sciences, primarily physics and chemistry, to engineering problems. Some classical and emerging engineering areas that fall within this field include thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, engineering mechanics, engineering materials, nuclear and chemical sciences, microelectronics theory and fabrication, manufacturing, metrology, and the solid state sciences.

### Degree Programs

The [Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science](http://mees.charlotte.edu/) offers an undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.) degree (with optional Concentrations in Biomedical Engineering, Energy Engineering, Motorsports Engineering, and Precision Engineering and Metrology) and graduate programs leading to Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (M.S.M.E.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees.  Additionally, a dual bachelor’s degree program is offered in cooperation with the Department of Physics. Using the flexibility provided by the technical electives, and with engineering career counseling, a student can develop a variety of educational programs that would provide the background for professional engineering licensing and practice in any of the areas included within mechanical engineering and/or the engineering sciences. Students can also prepare for graduate study in mechanical engineering, materials science, or any of the recognized areas covered by the engineering sciences. Individualized study programs in one of the interdisciplinary fields involving the merger of engineering and the various science areas, such as bioengineering, microelectronics, or chemical engineering sciences, can be developed.

### Program Educational Objectives

- Our graduates apply their knowledge to enable them to succeed as engineers in: society, graduate or professional studies, and lifelong learning.
- Our graduates contribute to safety and make ethical engineering and societal decisions.
- Our graduates contribute to the design, manufacture, implementation and management of engineering systems.
- Our graduates are equipped with strong engineering fundamentals and have the flexibility and competence to adapt in a changing world.
- Our graduates innovate, develop and communicate ideas and solutions, as effective technical leaders, team leaders, or team members.

### Student Outcomes

Upon graduation, our students will have:

1. An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
2. An ability to apply the engineering design process to create thermal or mechanical systems that meet specified application goals with consideration for public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
3. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences through oral and technical writing.
4. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
5. A record of productive participation as team members or in leadership roles on multidisciplinary teams which create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
6. An ability to develop experimental protocols and perform experiments designed to test or verify mechanical principles, components, and properties; analyzeresults; interpret data; and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
7. An ability to obtain and apply new knowledge, using appropriate learning strategies.

### Accreditation

The programs in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, [www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org/).
