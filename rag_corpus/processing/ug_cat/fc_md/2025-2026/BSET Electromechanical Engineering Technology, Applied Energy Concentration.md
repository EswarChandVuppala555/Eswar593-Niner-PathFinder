| * * * |

A Concentration in Applied Energy is available to [BSET in Electromechanical Engineering Technology](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11498) students.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>#### First-Year Students<br>First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​for a detailed description of the criteria.<br>First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.<br>#### Transfers<br>All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).  <br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​  <br>- Minimum GPA:  2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)<br>- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  <br>  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt546)), with a grade of C or above<br>  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt4765)) or higher, with a grade of C or above<br>- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24<br>Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Electromechanical Engineering Technology must:<br>- Complete the College of Engineering Common First Year (or equivalent courses) in order to be considered eligible for admission. See **Common First-Year Courses** below.<br>- Achieve a GPA between 2.2 - 4.0.<br>- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the [Change of Major](http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform) form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.<br>## Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY)<br>* * *<br>The College of Engineering uses a Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY) for all Engineering students in order to:<br>- Provide a strong academic base of foundational knowledge and skills<br>- Facilitate changing majors within the first year<br>- Support students with lower math placement and increase access to all majors<br>- Allow students to explore different majors before committing<br>- Enhance learning with innovative pedagogies and activities<br>##### Common First-Year Courses<br>All new first year students are initially advised by a central office within the W.S. Lee College of Engineering. Students must complete the following classes that are common to all majors of the college (except Construction Management and Fire and Safety Engineering Technology) in order to progress and matriculate to their major department. _All First-Year Curriculum courses require a grade of C or better._<br>- [ENGR 1300 Exploring Engineering & Technology with Success](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt1260) (2)<br>- [ENGR 1301 Foundations of Math and Science for Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt7424) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1302 Logic and Computational Problem Solving](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt8256) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1303 Engineering Visualization and Graphical Communication](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt7379) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt1744) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt6754) (1)<br>- Two MATH courses: [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt5565)\* or [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt7229)\* or [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt5326)\* (3 each) <br>  <br>_See Notes 1 and 2 below_<br>\* All students should consult their advisor to select the math courses that match their planned major.<br>##### Note 1<br>Progression into Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Systems Engineering Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students also complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt4933), [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt7251),  [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt8975), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt938). <br>##### Note 2<br>Progression into Civil Engineering Technology, Electromechanical Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt5255), [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt6782), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11654#tt9459) with a C or better (except for Electromechanical Engineering Technology).  <br>##### Note 3<br>Students must earn at least a 2.0 GPA in the first semester to continue into the second semester.<br>## Degree Requirements<br>* * *<br>A major in Electromechanical Engineering Technology with a concentration in Applied Energy leading to the B.S.E.T degree consists of a total of 120 credit hours.
