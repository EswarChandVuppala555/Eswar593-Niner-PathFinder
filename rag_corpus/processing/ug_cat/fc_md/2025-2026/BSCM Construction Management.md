| * * * |

The Bachelor of Science in Construction Management (BSCM) degree program is designed to provide the construction education necessary for entry into the construction industry (residential, commercial, industrial sectors, and heavy horizontal construction) and related careers, including, but not limited to, real estate and land development, infrastructure development, code enforcement, and insurance, among others.

The Construction Management program has been crafted to provide the student with extensive experience and practicum in the fundamentals of Construction Management (Plan Reading, Means and Methods, Cost Estimating, Project Planning and Scheduling and Construction Administration and Risk).

The program is further enhanced by business / management core courses in statistics, computer applications, economics, accounting, organization and supply chain management, and construction law which allows the student to pursue a [minor in Business (Operations and Supply Chain Management)](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11463).

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year students or as transfer students.<br>#### First-Year Students<br>Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general University admission requirements.

Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department.  Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>## Special Policies or Requirements<br>* * *<br>Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only.  These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.<br>#### Residence Requirements<br>A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.<br>#### Experiential Learning Requirements<br>All students must complete an experiential learning course.  Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, Senior design projects, or undergraduate research.<br>Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience.  A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program.  Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time.  Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time.  Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible.  Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student’s transcript; students pay a course registration fee.  Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience.  Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year. Transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before applying to the program.  For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center. |
