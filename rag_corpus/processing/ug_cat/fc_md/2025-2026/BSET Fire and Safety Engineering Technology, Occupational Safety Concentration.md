| * * * |

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program include [Fire Safety](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11499) and Occupational Safety.  Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

Occupational safety is a career path where professionals recognize, evaluate, and control workplace hazards, which exist in almost every industry. Building on a strong background in the life and physical sciences, students learn about fire prevention/protection, environmental pollution control, industrial hazards, industrial hygiene (industrial health), and ergonomics in this multi-disciplinary program. An experiential capstone experience (internship, co-op, or a supervised directed project) is required. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Occupational Safety concentration.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year students or as transfer students.<br>#### First-Year Students<br>Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general University admission requirements. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854).<br>#### Transfers<br>See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854).<br>Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:<br>1. Transfer applicants who do not have the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.<br>2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:<br>- Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter.  Acceptable AAS degrees may include: Fire Protection, Fire Science, or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department.  A minimum GPA of 2.50 (out of 4.00) in the AAS degree is required.<br>- Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter. Missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Occupational Safety must first satisfy the following requirements in order to be considered eligible for admission:<br>- Complete [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11865#tt7173) or higher with a grade of C or better.<br>- Achieve a GPA between 2.2 - 4.0.<br>- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is passed within three attempts.<br>- Complete at least one of the following Occupational Safety courses in the curriculum [ETGR 2230](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11865#tt3611), [ETFS 2230](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11865#tt8460) or [ETFS 3123](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11865#tt8095). Other courses may be approved by  the Program Director and the Academic Advisor on a case-by-case basis. <br>Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission by submitting the [Change of Major](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform?usp=sf_link) form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.<br>#### Course Requirements<br>Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter. All ETFS courses require a grade of C or better. Other courses required may also have this requirement since they may serve as a prerequisite.<br>- **Entering First-Year Students**: Students admitted as First-Year students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.<br>- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.<br>- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded.  Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.<br>#### Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers<br>Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:<br>- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)<br>- Precalculus (3 credit hours)<br>- Physics with lab (4 credit hours)<br>- Chemistry with Lab (4 credit hours)<br>- Principles of Biology (3 credit hours)<br>- Human Anatomy and Physiology (3 credit hours)<br>- Earth Science with lab (4 credit hours)<br>- Environmental Science (3 credit hours)<br>- Intro to Psychology (3 credit hours)<br>- Technical Courses in Major Area as listed below (up to 30 credit hours)<br>  - Introduction to Fire Protection and Prevention<br>  - Introduction to Fire Behavior<br>  - Hazardous Materials<br>  - Occupational Safety<br>  - Construction Safety<br>  - Computer-Aided Drafting<br>  - Electronic Circuits/DC Circuits<br>  - Industrial/Organizational Psychology<br>  - Statistics<br>#### Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students<br>In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year.  Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in Senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.<br>## Degree Requirements (4-Year Program)<br>* * *<br>The BSET in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology with a Concentration in Occupational Safety program consists of 120 credit hours. <br>### General Education Courses (31-32 credit hours)<br>* * *<br>For details on required General Education courses, refer to the [General Education Program](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11681). Total hours to satisfy General Education Requirements may vary as some general education requirements may be double-counted in the major with departmental approval. For example, 13 credit hours of math/science coursework counts as both general education under the major’s Math/Science requirements. Please see your advisor for information. <br>### Mathematics and Science Foundation Courses (30 credit hours)<br>* * *<br>Foundational Math/Science coursework prepares students for coursework in the
