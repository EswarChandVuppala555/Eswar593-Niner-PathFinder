| * * * |

Students pursuing the [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11491) (BSEE) degree may choose to add a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems. The plan of study for the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems is similar to the BSEE plan of study with three primary exceptions:

1. All BSEE students are required to complete Technical Elective courses, usually during the Junior and Senior year. Students pursuing the BSEE with a Concentration in Power and Energy Systems are required to enroll in approved Power and Energy Technical Electives only. _See required courses below._
2. During the Senior year, Power and Energy Systems Concentration students must complete an intensive, two-semester energy-related Senior design project.
3. Students in the concentration are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam prior to graduation.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>#### First-Year Students<br>First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​for a detailed description of the criteria.<br>First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.<br>#### Transfers<br>All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).  <br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​  <br>- Minimum GPA:  2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)<br>- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  <br>  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt5866)), with a grade of C or above<br>  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt6502)) or higher, with a grade of C or above<br>- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24<br>Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>#### Internal Change of Major<br>Internal change of majors within the College of Engineering must have a minimum GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering). Students who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>#### Change of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering<br>First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:<br>- Complete the Common First-Year Curriculum.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>#### Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.<br>- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.<br>- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.<br>- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1300](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt2419), [ENGR 1301](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt6995), [ENGR 1302](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt6672) or [ENGR 1303](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt6835) via a request to the [College of Engineering Advising department](http://engr.charlotte.edu/advising) at osds-advising@charlotte.edu.<br>#### Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major<br>Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student’s eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student’s entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:<br>- Complete the Common First-Year Curriculum.<br>- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).<br>- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.<br>## Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY)<br>* * *<br>The College of Engineering uses a Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY) for all Engineering students in order to:<br>- Provide a strong academic base of foundational knowledge and skills<br>- Facilitate changing majors within the first year<br>- Support students with lower math placement and increase access to all majors<br>- Allow students to explore different majors before committing<br>- Enhance learning with innovative pedagogies and activities<br>##### Common First-Year Courses<br>All new first year students are initially advised by a central office within the W.S. Lee College of Engineering. Students must complete the following classes that are common to all majors of the college (except Construction Management and Fire and Safety Engineering Technology) in order to progress and matriculate to their major department. _All First-Year Curriculum courses require a grade of C or better._<br>- [ENGR 1300 Exploring Engineering & Technology with Success](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt5606) (2)<br>- [ENGR 1301 Foundations of Math and Science for Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt5291) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1302 Logic and Computational Problem Solving](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt1546) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1303 Engineering Visualization and Graphical Communication](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt9381) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt7235) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt9085) (1)<br>- Two MATH courses: [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt4698)\* or [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt5017)\* or [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt6267)\* (3 each) <br>  <br>_See Notes 1 and 2 below_<br>\* All students should consult their advisor to select the math courses that match their planned major.<br>##### Note 1<br>Progression into Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Systems Engineering Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students also complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt7119), [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt7061),  [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt8748), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt5888). <br>##### Note 2<br>Progression into Civil Engineering Technology, Electromechanical Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt2200), [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=40&coid=140357), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11492#tt1757) with a C or better (except for Electromechanical Engineering Technology).  <br>##### Note 3<br>Students must earn at least a 2.0 GPA in the first semester to continue into the second semester.<br>## Degree Requirements<br>* * *<br>### General Education Courses (31-32 credit hours)<br>* * *<br>For details on required general education courses, refer to the [General Education Program](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11681). Total hours to satisfy General Education Requirements may vary as some general education requirements may be double-counted in the major with departmental approval.
