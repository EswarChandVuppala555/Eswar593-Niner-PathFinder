| * * * |

Civil Engineering Technology includes computer-aided drafting (CAD); structures (analysis, design of structural steel and reinforced concrete); construction (cost estimating, construction planning and administration); transportation (surveying, highway design and construction); water resources (hydraulics, hydrology, and environmental); and geotechnical (soil mechanics, foundations and earthwork).

The Civil Engineering Technology program shares a common curriculum with the Construction Management program for the first two years.  Students may move between the common programs until the Junior year when the curricula diverge.  At the end of the Sophomore year, students must select either the analysis and design-oriented Civil Engineering Technology BSET degree or the management-oriented BSCM program.

AAS transfer students from approved programs receive 64 credit hours for the AAS degree; thus, AAS students need only to complete the upper-division portion of the courses listed below and remediate any entrance deficiencies noted upon matriculation.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854). |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>#### First-Year Students<br>First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​for a detailed description of the criteria.<br>First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years.  This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.<br>#### Transfers<br>All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).  <br>- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) ​  <br>- Minimum GPA:  2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)<br>- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:  <br>  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt5767)), with a grade of C or above<br>  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt8596)) or higher, with a grade of C or above<br>- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24<br>Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.<br>## Currently Enrolled Students<br>* * *<br>Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Civil Engineering Technology must:<br>- Complete the College of Engineering Common First Year (or equivalent courses) in order to be considered eligible for admission. See **Common First-Year Courses** below.<br>- Achieve a GPA between 2.2 - 4.0.<br>- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the [Change of Major](http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform) form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.<br>#### Course Requirements<br>Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.<br>- **Entering First-Year Students**: Students admitted as First-Year students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.<br>- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.<br>- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree**: Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.<br>#### Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers<br>Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:<br>- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)<br>- Precalculus (3 credit hours)<br>- General Physics (with lab) (4 credit hours)<br>- Additional Physics (with lab) or Geology (3-4 credit hours)<br>- Technical Courses in Major Area (up to 41 credit hours)<br>  - ET Computer Applications<br>  - Computer Aided Drafting<br>  - Construction Surveying<br>  - Statics<br>  - Strength of Materials<br>  - Construction Materials with Lab<br>  - Construction Methods<br>  - Hydraulics or hydrology or environmental technology<br>  - Building Information Modeling<br>  - Plan Reading and Quantity Takeoff<br>#### Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students<br>In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year. Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in Senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.<br>## Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY)<br>* * *<br>The College of Engineering uses a Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY) for all Engineering students in order to:<br>- Provide a strong academic base of foundational knowledge and skills<br>- Facilitate changing majors within the first year<br>- Support students with lower math placement and increase access to all majors<br>- Allow students to explore different majors before committing<br>- Enhance learning with innovative pedagogies and activities<br>##### Common First-Year Courses<br>All new first year students are initially advised by a central office within the W.S. Lee College of Engineering. Students must complete the following classes that are common to all majors of the college (except Construction Management and Fire and Safety Engineering Technology) in order to progress and matriculate to their major department. _All First-Year Curriculum courses require a grade of C or better._<br>- [ENGR 1300 Exploring Engineering & Technology with Success](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt9642) (2)<br>- [ENGR 1301 Foundations of Math and Science for Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt4487) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1302 Logic and Computational Problem Solving](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt310) (3)<br>- [ENGR 1303 Engineering Visualization and Graphical Communication](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt3569) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt1565) (3)<br>- [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt2900) (1)<br>- Two MATH courses: [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt6749)\* or [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt3025)\* or [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt3113)\* (3 each) <br>  <br>_See Notes 1 and 2 below_<br>\* All students should consult their advisor to select the math courses that match their planned major.<br>##### Note 1<br>Progression into Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Systems Engineering Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students also complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt8404), [MATH 1242](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt1685),  [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt1054), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt271). <br>##### Note 2<br>Progression into Civil Engineering Technology, Electromechanical Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering Technology Major Courses after completing the Common First Year Curriculum requires that students complete [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt6734), [PHYS 2101](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt1934), and [PHYS 2101L](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11497#tt5578) with a C or better (except for Electromechanical Engineering Technology).  <br>##### Note 3<br>Students must earn at least a 2.0 GPA in the first semester to continue into the second semester.<br>## Degree Requirements (4-Year Program)<br>* * *<br>The BSET in Civil Engineering Technology program consists of 120 credit hours. <br>### General Education Courses (31-32 credit hours)<br>* * *<br>For details on General Education courses, refer to the [General Education Program](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11681). Total hours to satisfy General Education Requirements may vary as some general education requirements may be double-counted in the major with departmental approval.
