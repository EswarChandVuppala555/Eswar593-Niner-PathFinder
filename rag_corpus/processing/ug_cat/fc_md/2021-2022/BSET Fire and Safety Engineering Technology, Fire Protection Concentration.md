| * * * |

The Fire and Safety Engineering Technology (FSET) program at UNC Charlotte prepares graduates of the BSET program for careers across a broad spectrum of technologies. The program has emphasis on both technical and non-technical aspects in the fields of fire and safety.

Concentrations within the program encompass [Fire Safety](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7556), Fire Protection, and [Occupational Safety](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7948).  Many of the lower division courses are common between the concentrations, while the upper division allows specialization within the chosen concentration area.

The Fire Protection concentration is intended for students who are interested in investigating and assessing loss due to fire, along with identifying and enhancing fire prevention techniques and /or mitigation strategies. This multi-disciplinary program introduces areas encompassing construction/ built environment, electrical, mechanical, physical sciences and mathematics, in addition to providing a solid foundation in fire science and safety, through coursework and experiential learning. Quantitative and computer skills are heavily emphasized throughout the program and a capstone experience is required. Students completing the requirements identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Fire Protection concentration. |
| ## Admission Requirements<br>* * *<br>Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as freshmen or as transfer students.<br>## Freshman Admission<br>Applicants entering as Freshmen must meet the general University admission requirements.<br>## Transfer Admission<br>Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:<br>1. Transfer applicants not having the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.<br>2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:<br>   - Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter.Acceptable AAS degrees may include Architectural, Automation, Building Construction, Civil, Construction, Computer, Controls, Design and Drafting, Electrical, Electronics, Environmental, Fire Protection, Fire Science, Industrial, Instrumentation, Manufacturing, Mechanical, Optics, Robotics, Surveying or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department.A minimum GPA of 2.5 (out of 4.0) in the AAS degree is required.<br>   - Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter (missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte).<br>Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only.  These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.<br>## Residence Requirements<br>A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.<br>## Experiential Learning Requirements<br>All students must complete an experiential learning course.  Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate research.<br>Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience.  A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program.  Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time.  Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time.  Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible.  Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student’s transcript; students pay a course registration fee.  Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience.  Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year; transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before making application for the program.  For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.<br>## Course Requirements<br>Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.<br>- Entering Freshmen:  Students admitted as Freshmen complete the appropriate four year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.<br>- Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree:  Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four year curriculum that they were admitted into after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.<br>- Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree:  Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded.  Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.<br>## Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers<br>Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:<br>- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)<br>- Precalculus (3 credit hours)<br>- Differential and Integral Calculus (6 credit hours)<br>- General Physics (with lab) (4 credit hours)<br>- Chemistry (3 credit hours)<br>- Technical Courses in Major Area as listed below (up to 38 credit hours)<br>  - Introduction to Fire Protection and Prevention<br>  - Water Based Fire Suppression<br>  - Fire Investigation<br>  - Building Construction<br>  - Introduction to Fire Behavior<br>  - Occupational Safety<br>  - Computer-Aided Drafting<br>  - Statics<br>  - Strength of Materials<br>  - DC Circuits<br>  - Statistics<br>## Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students<br>In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year.  Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.<br>## Academic Progression Requirements<br>#### Freshman Year Requirements<br>All new freshmen, including early college and dual enrolled students that have college credit prior to high school graduation, are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.<br>- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.<br>- Follow all prerequisite, co-requisite, and progression requirements of their program.<br>- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.<br>- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the Freshman curriculum.<br>#### Sophomore through Senior Year Requirements<br>- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.000 in the University.<br>- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.000 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>- Take a course in their curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.<br>An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to reenroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering.  If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor.  A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Readmission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic.  An application for readmission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department.  Students who are readmitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation.  These requirements are specified in a “Continuation Agreement” that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor.  The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself.  However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.<br>## Degree Requirements (4-Year Program)<br>* * *<br>The BSET in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology with a Concentration in
