| ## Introduction<br>* * *<br>[The William States Lee College of Engineering](http://engr.uncc.edu/)’s vision is that:<br>The College is _**the engineering college of first choice**_ for students, faculty, staff, and industry partners discovering, integrating, applying, and disseminating knowledge.<br>The College provides quality educational experiences and discovers and disseminates knowledge that serves the citizens and industries of the Carolinas, and the national and the international communities.<br>The Lee College of Engineering offers baccalaureate degree programs in Engineering, Engineering Technology, and Construction Management.  On the graduate level, the College offers programs leading to master’s degrees in Engineering, Construction and Facilities Engineering, Energy and Electromechanical Systems, Fire Protection and Safety Management, and Engineering Management; Ph.D.s in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering; and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Infrastructure and Environmental Systems.  For details on the graduate programs, refer to the _UNC Charlotte Graduate Catalog_.<br>The College of Engineering consists of the following departments:<br>- [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=29&ent_oid=1500)<br>- [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=29&ent_oid=1501)<br>- [Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=29&ent_oid=1502)<br>- [Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=29&ent_oid=1503)<br>- [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=29&ent_oid=1504)<br>## Degree Programs<br>* * *<br>### Engineering Programs<br>The baccalaureate programs in engineering offer a professional engineering education that can be used as the foundation for several different career objectives: careers as professional engineers in industry, business, or consulting; graduate study to prepare for careers in research, development, or teaching; and a more general and more liberal engineering education with the objective of keeping a variety of career paths open. <br>Whatever the career objective of the student, a sound engineering educational program is provided.  The course of study will involve the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences and design. The student expecting to accept employment in industry may emphasize the engineering design and engineering science aspects of his or her program, while the student preparing for graduate study might emphasize the mathematics and science aspects. Some engineering graduates ultimately take on executive and management responsibilities in industries and firms that are based upon engineering products and engineering services.  These students may choose to construct an elective option in their program, including economics and business-related courses that strengthen their communication skills and other non-technical skills.<br>Engineering students are strongly encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer (PE). The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure subsequent to graduation include the accumulation of at least four years of progressive engineering experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master’s degree only need three years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.<br>#### Majors<br>- [Civil Engineering, B.S.C.E.](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7545)<br>- [Civil Engineering, Energy Infrastructure Concentration, B.S.C.E.](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7546)<br>- [Civil Engineering, Land Development Engineering Concentration, B.S.C.E.](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7719)<br>- [Computer Engineering, B.S.CP.E.](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=7549)<br>- [Computer Engineering, Machine Learning Concentration, B.S.CP.E.](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=8304)<br>- [Physics and Computer Engineering, B.S.
