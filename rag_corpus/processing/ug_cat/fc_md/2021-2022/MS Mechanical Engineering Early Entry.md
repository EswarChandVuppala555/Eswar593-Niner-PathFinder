Exceptional undergraduate students at UNC Charlotte may apply to this Early Entry Program to begin work toward a graduate degree before completion of the baccalaureate degree.

### Admission Requirements

- Completion of at least 75 earned undergraduate credit hours applicable to the B.S.M.E. degree
- Minimum 3.2 overall undergraduate GPA
- Acceptable scores on the GRE _(Exceptional undergraduate students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or above may receive an automatic waiver of the GRE requirement)_
- Submit application online at [mygradschool.uncc.edu](http://mygradschool.uncc.edu/) and provide supporting documents
- Recommendation by the Graduate Program Director and approval by The Graduate School

### Continued Enrollment Requirements

- Completion of Early Entry Program Form prior to registering for graduate coursework each semester
- Maintain a minimum 3.0 overall undergraduate GPA
- Undergraduate students are allowed to take only 15 hours of graduate credit before they have completed their baccalaureate degree

### Double-Counted Courses

This Early Entry Program is also accelerated; up to 12 credit hours earned at the graduate level may be substituted for required undergraduate hours.  In other words, up to 12 credit hours of graduate coursework may be “double counted” toward both the undergraduate and graduate degrees.
