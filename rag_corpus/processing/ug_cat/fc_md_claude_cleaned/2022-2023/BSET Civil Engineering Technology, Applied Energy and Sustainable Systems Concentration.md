# Civil Engineering Technology, Applied Energy and Sustainable Systems Concentration, B.S.E.T.

A Concentration in Applied Energy and Sustainable Systems is available to [BSET in Civil Engineering Technology](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=32&poid=8372) students.

## Admission Requirements

Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as freshmen or as transfer students.

### Freshman

Applicants entering as Freshmen must meet the general University admission requirements.

### Transfers

Transfer student admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:

1. Transfer applicants not having the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:
   - Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter. Acceptable AAS degrees may include Architectural, Automation, Building Construction, Civil, Construction, Computer, Controls, Design and Drafting, Electrical, Electronics, Environmental, Fire Protection, Fire Science, Industrial, Instrumentation, Manufacturing, Mechanical, Optics, Robotics, Surveying or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department. A minimum GPA of 2.5 (out of 4.0) in the AAS degree is required.
   - Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for the option they plan to enter (missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte).

2. Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.

### Residence Requirements

A student must earn the last 30 credit hours toward the BSET degree and the last 12 credit hours in the major at UNC Charlotte to satisfy residence requirements.

### Experiential Learning Requirements

All students must complete an experiential learning course. Experiential courses are practice-oriented courses such as cooperative education, internships, senior design projects, or undergraduate research.

Internships, or 49erships, involve paid or unpaid work in a career-related position for professional experience. A minimum of 80 work hours and 5 weeks for one semester is required to complete the program. Fall and Spring 49erships are part-time. Summer 49erships may be full- or part-time. Full-time students who are in good University standing, have completed 30 credit hours, and have a 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible. Internships do not offer academic credit, but are noted on the student's transcript; students pay a course registration fee. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins a work experience. Students may begin this program during their Sophomore year; transfer students must complete 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte before making application for the program. For more information, contact the College of Engineering Office of Student Development and Success or the University Career Center.

### Course Requirements

Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student as outlined hereafter.

- Entering Freshmen: Students admitted as Freshmen complete the appropriate four year curriculum for the program into which they were admitted.
- Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree: Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective four year curriculum that they were admitted into after evaluation and application of any transfer credit.
- Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree: Transfer students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a community or technical college are listed below.

### Prerequisite Courses for AAS Transfers

Students transferring with an AAS degree must have satisfactorily completed the following subjects in their two-year program:

- English Composition, Technical Writing, and/or Public Speaking (3 credit hours)
- Precalculus (3 credit hours)
- General Physics (with lab) (4 credit hours)
- Additional Physics (with lab) or Geology (3-4 credit hours)
- Technical Courses in Major Area (up to 41 credit hours)
  - ET Computer Applications
  - Computer Aided Drafting
  - Construction Surveying
  - Statics
  - Strength of Materials
  - Construction Materials with Lab
  - Construction Methods
  - Hydraulics or hydrology or environmental technology
  - Building Information Modeling
  - Plan Reading and Quantity Takeoff

### Remediation of Academic Entrance Requirements for AAS Transfer Students

In addition to University and College of Engineering requirements, an AAS transfer student who is admitted to any BSET program without meeting ALL published admission requirements is expected to remove all admission deficiencies within one year. Violators are subject to discontinuance and enrollment in senior-level coursework is prohibited until all deficiencies are removed.

## Degree Requirements

The BSET in Civil Engineering Technology with Concentration in Applied Energy and Sustainable Systems consists of 120 credit hours.
