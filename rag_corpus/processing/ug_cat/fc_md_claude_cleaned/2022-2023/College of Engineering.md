## Degree Programs

### Engineering Programs

The baccalaureate programs in engineering offer a professional engineering education that can be used as the foundation for several different career objectives: careers as professional engineers in industry, business, or consulting; graduate study to prepare for careers in research, development, or teaching; and a more general and more liberal engineering education with the objective of keeping a variety of career paths open.

Whatever the career objective of the student, a sound engineering educational program is provided. The course of study will involve the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences and design. The student expecting to accept employment in industry may emphasize the engineering design and engineering science aspects of his or her program, while the student preparing for graduate study might emphasize the mathematics and science aspects. Some engineering graduates ultimately take on executive and management responsibilities in industries and firms that are based upon engineering products and engineering services. These students may choose to construct an elective option in their program, including economics and business-related courses that strengthen their communication skills and other non-technical skills.

Engineering students are strongly encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer (PE). The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure subsequent to graduation include the accumulation of at least four years of progressive engineering experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need three years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.

### Engineering Technology Programs

Engineering technology is the profession in which knowledge of mathematics and natural sciences gained by higher education, experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity. Engineering technology education focuses primarily on the applied aspects of science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in that portion of the technological spectrum closest to the product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions.

Engineering technology programs are characterized by a focus on application and practice and on an approximately equal mix of theory, practice, and laboratory experience.

Graduates of the engineering technology programs are recruited by most major technological companies in the U.S. They are employed across the technological spectrum but are best suited to areas that deal with application, implementation, production, and construction. Technical sales and customer service fields also account for many placements.

Engineering technology students are encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer. The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure following graduation include the accumulation of at least eight years of progressive experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need seven years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.

## Additional Engineering Programs and Opportunities

#### Maximizing Academic and Professional Success Program (MAPS)

The goals of the MAPS Program are to improve the retention, academic performance, and professional development of students who are committed to earning a degree from the William States Lee College of Engineering. The MAPS Program serves as a process for transition, as new College of Engineering students establish personal connections; learn, understand, and apply academic success and professional development strategies; and grow in self-confidence and personal independence. The MAPS Program also supports the University Center for Academic Excellence (UCAE) through funding of Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) leaders to provide additional student services for foundational first-year College of Engineering courses.

Assessment results consistently indicate that students who attend seven or more transition coaching sessions earn an average first-semester GPA of 3.2, as compared to non-participants with an average first-semester GPA of 2.7. Additionally, students who attend five or more PAL sessions during a semester for a given course typically earn a final course grade that is one-half, to one full letter grade higher compared to other students.

#### Freshman Learning Community (FLC)

The FLC is home to more than 200 College of Engineering freshmen who live, study, and interact in a single residence hall. Students benefit from having similar interests and course schedules. Students have free access to the Creativity Lab, a maker space, in the building. In addition, MAPS peer coaching and tutoring for a variety of Freshman courses are offered on-site. Other events such as engineering site visits, special study nights, and social activities are also available to participants.

#### Student Leadership Academy

The Leadership Academy is an optional two-year extracurricular program designed to develop the leadership potential of College of Engineering students through a series of weekend retreats with other students, faculty, and industry partners. Top industry executives help facilitate specific activities providing a current, real-world perspective on being a successful leader and communicator in business and in the community. Selected students who fulfill all requirements of the program receive transcript notation.

#### Engage ME!

Engage ME! is a diversity and inclusion program intended to build a strong community of College of Engineering students and to connect them with multiple opportunities outside of the college. The program recruits, retains, and graduates multicultural students from all degree programs. Social networking opportunities and activities, mentoring programs, and events foster academic and professional development. The program positions students to recognize and seize opportunities for success.

#### WE Engage!

WE Engage! supports the academic and professional development of women in engineering, engineering technology and construction management. The program promotes and fosters peer and professional networking among women engineers through interactions that increase the recruitment, retention, graduation, and job placement for College of Engineering women students.

#### Experiential Learning and Service Learning Opportunities

Students are encouraged to participate in professional work experiences in support of their academic and career development through the cooperative education, internships and service learning programs offered to students in the College. The College works with the University Career Center to expand experiential learning offerings to enable more students to graduate with career related experience.

#### Cooperative Education (Co-op) Program

Students may obtain practical work experience while pursuing their degree by participating in cooperative education whereby a student alternates semesters of full-time academic study with semesters of full-time work experience in industry. Students may also do back-to-back Co-op experiences if their Fall or Spring semester Co-op session is combined with a Summer session. The work experience is under the direction of the student's major department and is closely related to his or her field of study. Students who fulfill all requirements of the Co-op program receive transcript notation, can earn up to three credit hours for a technical elective, and will receive partial credit toward the professional practice requirement for registration as a Professional Engineer in North Carolina.

To be eligible for the Co-op program, a student must have completed at least 30 credit hours at UNC Charlotte, including a number of specified courses with an overall minimum GPA of 2.5. A transfer student is expected to have completed at least 12 credit hours at UNC Charlotte.

The Co-op student works closely with their academic advisor to ensure a clear path to graduation. Students who participate in Co-op traditionally are more highly recruited at higher starting salaries than other students.

Students interested in learning more about the advantages and opportunities of participating in this program should contact the College's Director for Student Professional Development and Employer Relations or the University Career Center.

#### Domestic Internships

A number of opportunities for internships (either for-credit or not) exist for students at local and regional employers. Internships for College of Engineering students are almost always paid positions. UNC Charlotte University Career Center defines an Internship as requiring a minimum of 80 work hours which need to be completed in no less than five weeks for one semester. Fall and Spring semester internships are part-time. Summer internships may be full- or part-time. All students are eligible to apply for and accept internships posted in Hire-A-Niner.

Internships posted by the University Career Center do not routinely offer academic credit. Students can earn credit, when other options are not available, by registering for UCOL 3410 (Career Development Internship). UCOL 3410 allows Junior- and Senior-level students to earn one to three hours of elective credit, depending on criteria set by the employer and the University Career Center in consultation with the student's major department. Approval for enrollment must be arranged before the student begins the work experience.

Students interested in learning more about the advantages and opportunities of participating in this program should contact the College's Director for Student Professional Development and Employer Relations or the University Career Center.

#### International Experiences

The College provides opportunities for overseas study, research, and/or an industrial experience. In many cases, students who meet eligibility requirements receive special scholarships and/or grants to help defray the cost of these programs.

#### Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam

The first step in professional licensure is the FE exam. Students in ABET accredited programs may take the FE Exam at any time. The College encourages students to take and successfully pass this national examination during their Senior year.

#### Continuing Engineering Studies

The College of Engineering sponsors various special educational programs for practicing engineers, technologists, technicians, and others, in addition to its regular academic degree programs and courses. These include conferences, short courses, seminars, and other continuing education programs designed to aid those practicing in technical professions and occupations to keep abreast of the latest developments in the rapidly expanding technology.
