# Civil Engineering, Land Development Engineering Concentration, B.S.C.E.

The [Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (B.S.C.E.)](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11489) with a Concentration in Land Development Engineering is intended for students interested in a specialized focus in land development engineering as it relates to civil engineering and infrastructure issues.

Through careful course selection and scheduling, students can obtain the Concentration in Land Development Engineering within the required 120 credit hour B.S.C.E. curriculum. Students completing the requirements described in this program receive a special designation on their transcripts showing they have completed the Concentration in Land Development Engineering.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854).

## Admission Requirements

### First-Year Students

First-year admission is competitive, based upon an overall evaluation of the high school record, with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science. See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=40&navoid=4854) for a detailed description of the criteria.

First-Year students may either select a major at the time of their application or may choose to be Engineering-undeclared. All First-Year College of Engineering students will take a common set of courses called the Common First Year. Towards the end of their first year, having completed all progression requirements, students will declare or confirm their Engineering Major for the second through fourth years. This selection may be the major they initially indicated or any other engineering major for which they meet the progression requirements.

### Transfers

All transfer students will be evaluated for placement into a departmental Program or the Common First Year program based on the evaluation of their transfer credits (consistent with the North Carolina articulation agreements).

- See University Admission Requirements
- Minimum GPA: 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering)
- Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:
  - Engineering Programs: Calculus I course (equivalent to [MATH 1241](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt4421)), with a grade of C or above
  - Engineering Technology Programs: Pre-calculus course (equivalent to [MATH 1103](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt8559)) or higher, with a grade of C or above
- Transferable Credit Hours: Minimum of 24

Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.

## Currently Enrolled Students

### Internal Change of Major

Internal change of majors within the College of Engineering must have a minimum GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering). Students who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.

### Change of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering

First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:

- Complete the Common First-Year Curriculum.
- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).

### Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major

- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.
- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.
- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.
- May request authorization to enroll in [ENGR 1300](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt7962), [ENGR 1301](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt4103), [ENGR 1302](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt4217) or [ENGR 1303](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=11649#tt6434) via a request to the [College of Engineering Advising department](http://engr.charlotte.edu/advising) at osds-advising@charlotte.edu.

### Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major

Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student's eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student's entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:

- Complete the Common First-Year Curriculum.
- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (2.80 for Mechanical Engineering).
- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.

## Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY)

The College of Engineering uses a Common First-Year Curriculum (CFY) for all Engineering students in order to:

- Provide a strong academic base of foundational knowledge and skills
- Facilitate changing majors within the first year
- Support students with lower math placement and increase access to all majors
- Allow students to explore different majors before committing
- Enhance learning with innovative pedagogies and activities

### Common First-Year Courses

All new first year students are initially advised by a central office within the W.S. Lee College of Engineering. Students must complete the following classes that are common to all majors of the college (except Construction Management and Fire and Safety Engineering Technology) in order to progress and matriculate to their major department. *All First-Year Curriculum courses require a grade of C or better.*
