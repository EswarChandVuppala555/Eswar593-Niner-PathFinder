# Electrical Engineering Technology, B.S.E.T.

The Bachelor of Science (BS) in Electrical Engineering Technology provides the knowledge, skills, and management experience needed for technical and professional careers in areas such as instrumentation and control, electronics manufacturing, robotics, automation, electrical power operations, technical sales, or field services.

Program of study is arranged in a logical sequence, with study moving from the most basic concepts through highly technical principles. A special focus is given to "learning while doing" with several courses held in advanced laboratories, and several professional courses are offered to assist in the development of managerial skills. Students also have direct access to a Master of Science degree in Applied Energy and Electromechanical Engineering, with as little as one additional year of study.

Coursework includes study in the following areas: electrical fundamentals, circuits and circuit design, digital fundamentals, solid state electronics, industrial control, microprocessors, automation, mathematics, computer fundamentals, electromechanical systems and science. In addition, students complete the interdisciplinary College of Engineering Senior Design program, which provides the knowledge students need in critical thinking, leadership, and interpersonal and communication skills.

Courses in the major are taught by full-time faculty. Small class sizes ensure each student has access to research laboratories and individualized assistance. Students benefit from specialized laboratories for study, filled with the most up-to-date equipment and supplies.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements.

## Admission Requirements

Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year students or as transfer students.

### First-Year Students

Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general University admission requirements.

### Transfer

The program welcomes transfer students at various levels of academic progression.

Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:

1. Transfer applicants who do not have the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University admission requirements.

2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree must:
   - Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field appropriate to the option they plan to enter. Acceptable AAS degrees may include: Automation, Computer, Controls, Electrical, Electronics, Industrial, Instrumentation, Manufacturing, Mechanical, Robotics, or similar title with curriculum acceptable to the department. A minimum GPA of 2.50 (out of 4.00) in the AAS degree is required.
   - Have completed satisfactorily, and transferred in, courses equivalent to the lower-level courses. Missing background courses may be taken at UNC Charlotte.

### Currently Enrolled Students

Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major to Electrical Engineering Technology must first satisfy the following requirements in order to be considered eligible for admission:

- Complete MATH 1103 or higher with a grade of C or better.
- Complete PHYS 1101 and PHYS 1101L or higher Physics course with a grade of C or better.
- Earn a minimum 2.20 cumulative GPA.
- Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is passed within three attempts.
- Complete at least one the following courses for their desired major:
  - ETGR 1201 or MATH 1121 with a grade of C or better

Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by submitting the Change of Major Form. Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a program.

## Progression Requirements

### First-Year Students

All First-Year students, early college students, and transfer students with only one semester at another institution are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.
- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.
- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.
- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of C or above. Core courses include ETGR 1201 or equivalent, MATH 1103, MATH 1121 or equivalent, PHYS 1101 and PHYS 1101L or equivalent.
- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.
- Earn a 2.00 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year curriculum.

### Sophomore Through Senior Year

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.
- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
- Take courses in the curriculum a maximum of three times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.

## Special Policies or Requirements

Acceptance of a completed AAS degree indicates the acceptance of up to 64 credit hours toward the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree program only. These hours may not be valid toward other degree programs at UNC Charlotte.
