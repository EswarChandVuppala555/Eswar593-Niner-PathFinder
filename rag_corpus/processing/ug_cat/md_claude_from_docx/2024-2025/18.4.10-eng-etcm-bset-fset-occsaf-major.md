# BSET in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology with Concentration in Occupational Safety

Occupational safety is a career path where professionals recognize,
evaluate, and control workplace hazards, which exist in almost every
industry. Building on a strong background in the life and physical
sciences, students learn about fire prevention/protection, environmental
pollution control, industrial hazards, industrial hygiene (industrial
health), and ergonomics in this multi-disciplinary program. An
experiential capstone experience (internship, co-op, or a supervised
directed project) is required. Students completing the requirements
identified for this concentration will receive a special designation on
their transcripts showing they have completed the Occupational Safety
concentration.

## Admission Requirements

Students for this degree may enter degree programs in the Department of
Engineering Technology and Construction Management as First-Year
students or as transfer students.

### First-Year Students

Applicants entering as First-Year students must meet the general
University admission requirements. See University Admission
Requirements.

### Transfers

See University Admission Requirements.

Transfer admission into the department occurs in one of two situations:

1. Transfer applicants who do not have the Associate in Applied Science
   (AAS) degree or its equivalent must meet general University
   admission requirements.

2. Transfer applicants with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS)
   degree must:

   - Hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in a field
     appropriate to the option they plan to enter. Acceptable AAS degrees
     may include: Fire Protection, Fire Science, or similar title with
     curriculum acceptable to the department. A minimum GPA of 2.50 (out
     of 4.00) in the AAS degree is required.

Have completed satisfactorily the prerequisite background courses for
the option they plan to enter. Missing background courses may be taken
at UNC Charlotte.

### Currently Enrolled Students

Current UNC Charlotte students who wish to change or declare their major
to Occupational Safety must first satisfy the following requirements in
order to be considered eligible for admission:

1. Complete MATH 1103 or higher with a grade of C or better.

2. Earn a minimum 2.20 cumulative GPA.

3. Pass all currently attempted required courses within three attempts
   including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

4. Students currently enrolled in a required course for a second time
   must wait until grades are posted before declaring an ETCM major. A
   student will not be admitted to the major unless the course is
   passed within three attempts.

5. Complete at least one Occupational Safety course in the curriculum.
   This course will be selected by the Program Director and the
   Academic Advisor on a case-by-case basis.

Upon satisfying all of the above requirements, students may request
admission by submitting the [Change of Major Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7L6QSOgR_dTpDhSMThVZX_JicyOFjlZRc7Z61IBeJ9PwmBA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Completion of the minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance
into a program.

## Course Requirements

Course requirements correspond to the mode of admission for each student
as outlined hereafter.

- **Entering First-Year Students**: Students admitted as First-Year
  students complete the appropriate four-year curriculum for the
  program into which they were admitted.

- **Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree:**
  Transfer students not holding an appropriate AAS degree must
  complete the remaining coursework outlined for the respective
  four-year curriculum into which they were admitted after evaluation
  and application of any transfer credit.

- **Transfer students holding an appropriate AAS degree:** Transfer
  students with an appropriate Associate of Applied Science (AAS)
  degree as defined previously under Admission Requirements may begin
  the program in the Junior year with up to 64 transfer credit hours
  awarded. Prerequisites for students holding an AAS degree from a
  community or technical college are listed below.
