## Degree Programs

### Engineering Programs

The Baccalaureate programs in engineering offer professional engineering education that can be used as the foundation for different career objectives: workforce ready professional engineers in industry, business, or consulting; graduate study preparing for careers in research, development, or teaching; and a more general and liberal engineering education with the objective of keeping a variety of career paths open.

The course of study will involve the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences and design. The student expecting to accept employment in industry may emphasize the engineering design and engineering science aspects of a program, while the student preparing for graduate study might emphasize the mathematics and science aspects. Some graduates take on executive and management responsibilities in industries and firms that are based upon engineering products and services. These students may choose to construct an elective option in their program to include economics and business-related courses that strengthen their communications and other non-technical skills.

Engineering students are strongly encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer (PE). The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure subsequent to graduation include the accumulation of at least four-years of progressive engineering experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need three years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.

All program-level Admission and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admissions Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=10288).

### Engineering Technology Programs

Engineering technology is the profession in which knowledge of mathematics and natural sciences gained through higher education, experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity. Engineering technology education focuses on the applied aspects of science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in the technological spectrum closest to product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions.

Engineering technology programs are characterized by a focus on application and practice with an approximately equal mix of theory, practice, and laboratory experience.

Graduates of the engineering technology programs are recruited by most major technological companies in the U.S. They are employed across the technological spectrum but are best suited to areas that deal with application, implementation, production, and construction. Technical sales and customer service fields also account for many placements.

Engineering technology students are encouraged to pursue the requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer. The first step in the registration process is the successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. Students are encouraged to take this examination during their Senior year. Additional requirements for professional licensure following graduation include the accumulation of at least eight years of progressive experience and successful completion of the Professional Engineer Examination (PE Exam). Students who complete the Cooperative Education Program or who complete their master's degree only need seven years of progressive engineering experience to be eligible to take the PE Exam in North Carolina.
