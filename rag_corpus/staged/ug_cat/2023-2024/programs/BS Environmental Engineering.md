# Environmental Engineering, B.S.

Coursework combines training in the core subject matter of Environmental Engineering with design experience that runs throughout the curriculum, students will have opportunities to assess, analyze, and solve real-world and locally relevant problems related to contamination of soils, water, and the atmosphere.

All program-level Admissions and Progression Requirements are in addition to the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045).

## Admission Requirements

### First-Year Students

First-Year admission is competitive. Based upon an overall evaluation of high school record with particular emphasis on advanced courses in math and science and SAT or ACT scores, First-Year students may be admitted directly to the environmental engineering major. SAT/ACT scores are not required through Fall 2024.

- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045)
- **Minimum GPA:** n/a
- **Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:** First-Year students MUST present a pre-calculus equivalent course, a math course during the high school Senior year (grade 12/13) or math intensive science course such as physics or chemistry if no math courses are available, with no grades below C in any math courses. Students with AP test scores of at least 3 on AP Calculus AB or BC or early college high school students who present transfer credit for calculus equivalent to MATH 1241 or higher are exempted from having a math course in the Senior year.
- Minimum SAT-Math score of 570 or ACT-Math subscore of 23 (not required through Fall 2024)
- **Declaration of Major:** Students may declare the major at time of admission or at any time if in good standing with the College and University.

### Transfers

- All transfer students will be admitted to the lower division of a department, and evaluation of transfer credits follows the North Carolina articulation agreements. Transfers from an ABET-accredited engineering program who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.
- See [University Admission Requirements](https://catalog.charlotte.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=4045)
- **Minimum GPA:** 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering)
- **Pre-Major/Prerequisite Courses:** Calculus I course (with grade of C or above) equivalent to MATH 1241
- **Transferable Credit Hours:** 24

## Currently Enrolled Students

A grade of C or above is required for selected major Courses. Students must earn at least a 2.50 GPA in the selected Concentration Courses.

### Internal Change of Major

Internal change of majors within the College of Engineering must have a minimum GPA of 2.50. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted upon the recommendation of the chair of the major department.

### Changes of Major Into a Program in the College of Engineering

First-time college students who seek eligibility for a change of major from a non-engineering major into an engineering program are required to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.
- Have no more than two attempts per course, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).
- Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major
- Should continue to be advised by their current advisor.
- Should focus on successfully completing courses that count towards the program of interest and not rely on grades in unrelated courses to elevate the GPA.
- Are not permitted to enroll in Sophomore engineering courses.
- May request authorization to enroll in ENGR 1201, ETGR 1201 or ETGR 1101 via a UCOL advisor or via a request to the College of Engineering Advising department at coe-advising@uncc.edu, if not in UCOL.
- May request authorization to enroll in ENGR 1202 via a UCOL advisor or via a request to an advisor in the program of interest, if not in UCOL.

### Transfers Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major

Students who transfer to Charlotte into a non-engineering major and have not met the Transfer Requirements for a given engineering program are not guaranteed to be considered for a change of major. Representatives of the program of interest make decisions on a student's eligibility to pursue a change of major based on a holistic review of a student's entire academic record, including grades earned at other institutions. A record of unsuccessful attempts in courses will weigh negatively on such decisions. If transfer students are allowed to pursue eligibility for a change of major to a given program, they will be required to:

- Complete the First-Year curriculum of the program of interest.
- Have no more than two attempts per course including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Achieve an overall GPA of 2.50 (3.00 for Mechanical Engineering).
- Complete at least 12 credits of courses at Charlotte, including at least four courses in math, science and/or engineering.

### Current UNC Charlotte Students Seeking Eligibility for a Change of Major

Current UNC Charlotte students who are interested in changing majors to Engineering Technology or Construction Management (ETCM) must meet major-specific requirements in order to declare a major. Please visit the [ETCM department](http://et.uncc.edu/prospective-students/change-majors) for more information on the change of major process. Upon satisfying all of the major-specific requirements, students may request admission to an ETCM program by scheduling an appointment with a departmental advisor of the given program.

## Progression Requirements

### First-Year Requirements

All new First-Year students, early college students, and transfer students with only one semester at another institution are initially advised by a central office within the College of Engineering. Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.

- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.
- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.
- Earn at least a 2.00 GPA in the first semester.
- Complete all core courses in the First-Year curriculum with grades of C or above. Core courses include: MATH 1241 and MATH 1242, PHYS 2101; CHEM 1251 or MEGR 1100 (MEGR majors); MATH 2164 and ECGR 2103 (CPGR/EEGR Majors); MATH 2164 (SEGR Majors).
- Pass all courses within two attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.
- Complete the First-Year curriculum within four regular semesters.
- Earn a 2.50 cumulative GPA upon completion of the First-Year curriculum.

### Sophomore Through Senior Year Requirements

- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.00 in the University.
- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
- Pass all courses in the curriculum within two attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.

An undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to re-enroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor.

A student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Re-admission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for re-admission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are re-admitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a "Continuation Agreement" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and their appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.
