All MEGR students are required to complete: a) a math elective and b) a course with appropriate statistics content. The math elective will not also count as a technical elective. For either option, five courses are required to fulfill the requirements of math, statistics and technical electives.

Option 1 - STAT 3128 fulfills math elective and statistics requirements (plus students will need four technical electives).  
Option 2 - MEGR 3282 plus MATH 2164 or MATH 3171

Biomedical Engineering students are required to fulfill the math elective via option 1 and the science elective via BIOL 1110 or BIOL 2120.

**At least three of the four courses that are required as technical electives must be courses with a MEGR course designation. Courses that are approved as technical electives are listed below. In parentheses beside each course are designations for approval as an elective for given concentration (B - Biomedical Engineering, E - Energy Engineering, and M - Motorsports Engineering). New technical electives may be offered as MEGR 3090, MEGR 3092, MEGR 3094 or MEGR 3097, and their descriptions are available each semester on a list in the Mechanical Engineering office, the MEES Academic Advising course in Canvas, and the MEES website.
