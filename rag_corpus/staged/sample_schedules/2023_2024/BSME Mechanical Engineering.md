>
> Option 1 - STAT 3128 fulfills math elective and statistics requirements (plus students will need four technical electives).
> Option 2 - MATH 2164 or MATH 3171 plus MEGR 3282 as a Technical Elective
>
> *Biomedical Engineering students are required to fulfill the math elective via option 1 and the science elective via BIOL 1110 or BIOL 2120.*
>
> **At least three of the four courses that are required as technical electives must be courses with a MEGR course designation. Courses that are approved as technical electives are listed below. In parentheses beside each course are designations for approval as an elective for given concentration (B - Biomedical Engineering, E - Energy Engineering, M - Motorsports Engineering, and P -- Precision Engineering and Metrology). New technical electives may be offered as MEGR 3090, MEGR 3092, MEGR 3094 or MEGR 3097, and their descriptions are available each semester on a list in the Mechanical Engineering office, the MEES Academic Advising course in Canvas, and the MEES website.

## Concentrations

BSME students may elect to complete an optional concentration requiring a one credit hour introductory course, technical electives approved for the chosen concentration, and a senior design sequence focused in the concentration area.
