1. You’ve completed the major-required courses (great!).  
2. You still need to take **ECGR 4105 - Introduction to Machine Learning**, which is required for your Machine Learning concentration.  
3. You need **3 more Machine Learning elective credit hours**, so you'll need one elective from your **Machine Learning electives list**.  
4. You’re unsure about taking Senior Design I (ECGR 4251). If you take it next semester, it might influence the number of other courses you can manage, so planning carefully around workload will be important.

Here’s a possible approach for next semester's courses:

---

### Suggested Courses for Next Semester:
1. **ECGR 4105 - Introduction to Machine Learning (3 credit hours)**  
   *Required for your concentration, so this should be a priority.*

2. **Machine Learning Elective (3 credit hours)**  
   Choose *one* course from the following list:  
   - ECGR 4106 - Real-Time Machine Learning  
   - ECGR 4115 - Convex Optimization and AI Applications  
   - ECGR 4127 - Machine Learning for the Internet of Things  
   - ECGR 4090 - Special Topics in Electrical Engineering (*requires department approval*)  

3. **Technical Elective (3 credit hours)**  
   Select a **3000- or 4000-level course** from areas like ECGR, MATH, ITCS, MEGR, or PHYS. Choose based on your interests and career goals.  

4. **ECGR 4251 - Senior Design I (2 credit hours)** (Optional for now)
   If you want to begin your capstone project, you can take this now. However, it’s a demanding course, so ensure you can balance this with your other courses.

---

### Questions to Consider:
- Are you planning to divide your remaining Machine Learning elective and technical electives between your last two semesters?  
- Would you like recommendations for specific technical electives or help deciding which Machine Learning elective fits your goals?  
- Do you feel ready to begin Senior Design I next semester? It’s a two-part course, so starting it now means you’ll take Senior Design II in your final semester.

However, I can give you a general idea of what courses you might be expected to take in your junior year based on the program structure:

### Typical Junior Year Courses
1. **Concentration Courses** (If not already covered):
   - ECGR 4105: *Introduction to Machine Learning* (A required concentration course).

2. **Core Major Courses**:
   - ECGR 3101: *Embedded Systems*  
   - ECGR 3111: *Signals and Systems*  
   - ECGR 3123: *Data Communications and Networking*  
   - ECGR 3131: *Fundamentals of Electronics and Semiconductors*  
   - ECGR 3157: *ECE Junior Design* (O)  

3. **Related Courses**:
   - MATH 2164: *Matrices and Linear Algebra* (if not already completed).  
   - STAT 3128: *Probability and Statistics for Engineers*.  

4. **Lab Courses**:
   - ECGR 3155: *Systems and Electronics Laboratory*  
   
5. **Machine Learning Concentration Elective** (Optional):  
   Consider courses like *ECGR 4106: Real-Time Machine Learning* or *ECGR 4115: Convex Optimization and AI Applications*, if you're ready to take a concentration elective.

### Important Considerations:
- **Prerequisites:** Make sure you've completed the necessary prerequisites before enrolling in upper-level or concentration courses.  
- **Technical Electives:** If you have space for electives and meet the prerequisites, you can choose from approved technical elective courses (ECGR, ITCS, MATH, etc.).
- **Advising Meeting:** Meeting with your advisor is critical to confirm your readiness for specific courses and to verify your program plan is on track.

However, I can guide you on how to determine which courses you might need to take based on your program requirements and progression.

Here are some key steps to help you plan:

1. **Review Your Degree Plan**: As a senior in the B.S.M.E. Energy Engineering concentration, you likely have most foundational courses completed and are focusing on:
   - Any remaining Major/Core courses
   - Restricted Electives (Design, Science, Math/Statistics, and Energy Technical Electives)
   - Senior-level requirements like capstone design projects (e.g., MEGR 3455 and MEGR 3456)

2. **Check Prerequisites**: Look at your completed courses and verify which required courses and electives have prerequisites. This will guide your enrollment choices.

3. **Consult with Your Academic Advisor**: Your advisor can help confirm which courses you should prioritize to stay on track for graduation. 

4. **Review the University’s Registration Portal**: Use your course registration system to check your Degree Works (or equivalent) to see a list of courses needed to fulfill your remaining degree requirements. It can also show which courses are being offered during the upcoming semester.

If you would like a more specific plan, please reach out to your advisor. They can access your records and ensure your selections meet your degree requirements for graduation.

Students must satisfy the following requirements in order to progress in the curriculum and matriculate to their major department.\n\n- Follow the advice and recommendations of their faculty advisors.\n- Follow all prerequisite, corequisite, and progression requirements of their program.\n- Earn at least a 2.250 GPA in the first semester.\n- Complete all non-elective courses in the Freshman year curriculum with grades of C or above.\n- Pass all courses within three attempts, including withdrawing from a course with a grade of W.\n- Complete the Freshman curriculum within three regular semesters, if starting in the required first semester mathematics course.\n- Earn a 2.500 cumulative GPA upon completion of the Freshman curriculum.\n\n### Sophomore through Senior Year Requirements\n\n- Maintain an overall GPA of 2.000 in the University.\n- Maintain a major cumulative GPA of 2.000 for all courses in the departmental curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semesters will result in not being permitted to enroll in College of Engineering courses.\n- Take courses in the curriculum a maximum of two times to achieve a satisfactory grade, including withdrawing from the course with a grade of W.\n\nAn undergraduate student who fails to satisfy one or more of the progression requirements stated above, but who nonetheless meets the conditions for continued enrollment in the University, will be ineligible to reenroll in the College of Engineering unless an appeal is accepted by the College of Engineering. If an appeal is accepted, requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to the individual situation are specified in a ""Continuation Agreement"" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor.\n\nA student who has been suspended by the University must follow University guidelines for appeal. Readmission to the College of Engineering after a University suspension is not automatic. An application for readmission must be made by the student and approved by the College/department. Students who are readmitted by the College of Engineering after suspension by the University must meet requirements for continued enrollment appropriate to their individual situation. These requirements are specified in a ""Continuation Agreement"" that is mutually agreed upon and signed by the student and his/her appropriate advisor. The consequences of failure to meet the requirements of the agreement may be articulated in the agreement itself. However, if these consequences are not included in the agreement, failure to meet the requirements will automatically result in the student not being permitted to continue to enroll in College of Engineering courses.\n\n## Additional Admission Requirements for Concentration\n\n- **Minimum GPA:** 3.0\n- **Prerequisite Courses (with grades of C or above):**\n  - PHYS 2101\n  - PHYS 2101L\n  - MATH 1242\n  - ENGR 1202\n  - WRDS 1103 or WRDS 1104\n  - MEGR 2141\n- **Declaration of Concentration:** Students must apply for admission to and may enter the concentration during their Sophomore or Junior year only\n\n### Academic Progression Requirements\n\nIn order to remain in the concentration, a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 must be maintained.\n\n## Degree Requirements\n\nA Major in Mechanical Engineering with a Concentration in Energy Engineering consists of a total of 121 credit hours.\n\n### General Education Courses (18-19 credit hours)\n\nFor details on required LBST and UWRT courses, refer to the General Education Program.
