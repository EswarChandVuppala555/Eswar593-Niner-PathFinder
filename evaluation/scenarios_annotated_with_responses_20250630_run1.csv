2,generic_1,Academic Planning & Course Selection,Are there any prerequisite chains I should be aware of that could delay my graduation?,Up to 29,2024-2025,BSME Mechanical Engineering,0,0,0,1,?,1,0,1,0,?,1,?,"Yes, there are several prerequisite chains in the **Mechanical Engineering B.S.M.E. program** that can impact your graduation timeline if not carefully planned. Mechanical Engineering is a structured and sequential program, meaning many courses depend on specific prerequisites. Here are key areas to watch for:

### 1. **Mathematics Sequence**
   - **MATH 1241 (Calculus I)** → **MATH 1242 (Calculus II)** → **MATH 2241 (Calculus III)** → **MATH 2171 (Differential Equations)**  
   - These courses form the foundation of the engineering curriculum. Any delays in completing this sequence will affect your ability to take core engineering courses, such as **PHYS 2101**, **MEGR 2141**, and other upper-level courses.

---

### 2. **Physics Sequence**
   - **PHYS 2101 (Physics for Science and Engineering I)** → **PHYS 2102 (Physics for Science and Engineering II)**  
   - Both are prerequisites for several engineering courses like **ENGR 1202**, **MEGR 2141**, and **MEGR 3111 (Thermodynamics I)**. Completing **Calculus I** is required for **PHYS 2101**, so it's critical to start math early.

---

### 3. **Core Engineering Courses**
   - Many sophomore-level courses have prerequisites, creating chains that need to be followed carefully:
     - **ENGR 1201 → ENGR 1202 → MEGR 2141 → MEGR 2156**
     - **MEGR 2141 (Engineering Mechanics I)** → **MEGR 2144 (Introduction to Solid Mechanics)** → **MEGR 3152 (Mechanics and Materials Lab)**  
       *Missing one course in this chain can delay several others.*

6,generic_1,Academic Planning & Course Selection,Are there any particularly challenging course combinations I should avoid taking together?,None yet!,2025-2026,BS Dual Degree Physics and Mechanical Engineering,0,0,0,1,?,1,?,?,0,0,1,?,"Great question! Balancing your course load is an important part of academic success—especially with a demanding program like the BS Dual Degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering. While every student's experience may vary, there are some general strategies to avoid overwhelming combinations:

### 1. **Avoid Multiple Heavy Lab Courses in the Same Semester**
   Physics and engineering programs often include intensive lab courses. These labs typically demand significant time for preparation, attendance, and post-lab analysis, which can quickly dominate your schedule. Try to balance lab courses with lecture-based or less time-intensive classes.

### 2. **Spread Out Math-Intensive Courses**
   Both physics and mechanical engineering make use of advanced math, like calculus and differential equations. Taking multiple math-heavy courses in the same semester (e.g., Engineering Dynamics, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism) can be overwhelming. Try to distribute these courses across different semesters.

### 3. **Watch for Capstone or Senior Design Overlap**
   When you approach your final years, be mindful of senior-level courses like a capstone project or senior design in engineering. These courses require significant collaboration, long-term planning, and presentations, which can interfere with the rigorous demands of other high-level coursework.

### 4. **Balance Theory with Application**
   Courses in your program may focus differently on theoretical concepts (like Quantum Mechanics) versus applied skills (like CAD or Fluid Mechanics). Mixing these types can help keep your workload manageable and better rounded.

### 5. **Consider General Education Timing**
   Don’t overlook general education courses! While they may seem easier or unrelated to your major, bundling too many technical courses together and pushing general education requirements later isn’t always ideal. Plan to mix in general education courses for a change of pace.

### Suggestions to Help Plan:
   - **Review your program map:** If course sequences or sample plans are available, use them to help guide your semester schedules.
   - **Meet with your advisor regularly:** Since your program spans two disciplines, your advisor can help ensure you're on track and not overscheduled in any one semester.
   - **Check prerequisites early:** Some courses have prerequisites that need to be taken in specific order, so mapping this out early can prevent scheduling conflicts.

1. **Credit Hours Remaining:**  
   The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) typically requires **120 credit hours** to graduate (though confirm this based on your program’s specific requirements for your catalog year). Since you’ve earned between **30 to 59 credits**, let’s assume you have approximately **61 to 90 credits** remaining.

2. **Course Load Per Semester:**  
   If you’re taking a **full-time course load** of 15 credit hours per semester (a common load to graduate in a timely manner), you could potentially complete roughly **30 credit hours per academic year (fall + spring)**. Summer courses could allow you to complete even more.

3. **Prerequisite Chains and Course Offerings:**  
   Engineering programs are typically structured with prerequisite chains, meaning some courses must be taken in sequence. Additionally, not every course may be offered every term, so you’ll need to plan carefully. Your Machine Learning Concentration courses could also add specific requirements that may extend your timeline if not sequenced properly. 

4. **Other Considerations:**  
   If you’re participating in internships, co-ops, or research opportunities, these may impact the number of credits you can take each term, potentially delaying graduation. However, these can build professional experience that’s incredibly valuable.

### Example Graduation Timeline:
- If you need **90 credits** and maintain 15 credits per semester (plus summer courses), you could realistically graduate in **3 years** (around **Spring 2026**).
- If you need closer to **61 credits**, a more aggressive plan with similar course loads could allow for graduation in **2 years** (around **Spring 2025**).

255,specific_1,Graduation Timeline & Requirements,"I have a ton of AP credit and want to graduate fast, like 2-3 years max, how fast can I graduate?",30 to 59,2025-2026,"BSEE Electrical Engineering, Machine Learning Concentration",0,0,0,1,1,,,,,,1,1,"Graduating in 2-3 years as an Electrical Engineering major with a Machine Learning concentration at UNC Charlotte is challenging but theoretically possible with significant AP credit **and very careful course planning.** The degree requires 120 credit hours including general education, major courses, concentration requirements, and electives, so your timeline depends on several key factors:

### Steps to Assess Feasibility
1. **Determine How Many Credits Transferred**
   - Find out exactly how your AP credits apply to required courses within your degree program. Do they satisfy general education requirements? Have you tested out of foundational courses like calculus or physics? Confirm these with your advisor.

2. **Identify Remaining Core Requirements**
   - Major-related coursework (like circuits, programming, and machine learning electives) follows a **strict sequence** due to prerequisites, which makes accelerating the program difficult. For example, you cannot take advanced courses until completing foundational ones like MATH 2164 and ECGR 2111.

3. **Course Load and Scheduling**
   - A maximum full-time course load is typically 18 credit hours per semester. To graduate in two years, you would need to take close to **20-30 credit hours per semester**, including possible summer courses.
   - Some technical upper-level courses may not be offered every semester, so you'll need to carefully plan your schedule well in advance.

4. **Utilize Summer Courses**
   - Completing major and general education classes during summer terms can significantly lighten your regular semester load and help you stay on track.

5. **Credit for Technical Electives**
   - If your AP courses can't apply to the core curriculum but can count as technical electives or unrestricted electives, use this to your advantage to reduce extra credit hours needed.

6. **Senior Design**
   - Your program finishes with a **Senior Design Project (ECGR 4241/4242)**, which typically spans two semesters your senior year. This may be hard to accelerate based on department scheduling.

---

### General Recommendations
- **Meet with Your Advisor Immediately**:
   Your advisor will evaluate your AP credits and help you create a realistic degree plan. This is essential to ensure you only take required courses and stay on top of prerequisites.

- **Plan for Heavy Workload**:
   Be prepared for intense semesters, as many engineering courses are time-intensive and demanding. Balancing 18+ credits with labs, projects, and studying requires excellent time management.

- **Leverage Opportunities for Substitutions**:
   Departments sometimes allow course substitutions for equivalent content. Work with your advisor to see if they can waive certain requirements for accelerated progress.

---

### Estimated Timeline Scenarios
1. **Two-Year Path**:
   - Likely possible only if you enter with **extensive AP/transfer credit** covering both your general education and lower-division major courses (e.g., Calculus I-III, Physics I-II, programming, etc.) and can handle consistent 18+ credit semesters plus summer coursework.

2. **Three-Year Path**:
   - More realistic if AP credit has substantially reduced your general education load but you need time to complete (in sequence) your upper-division major courses, including labs and Senior Design.
